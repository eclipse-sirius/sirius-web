= sirius-components-diagrams-layout

== Goal

This project contains our automatic layout support for diagrams.

== Dependencies

This project will depend on the following projects:

- sirius-components-diagrams-layout-api
- ELK

The dependency to EMF does not mean that this project should contain any EMF-specific code.
ELK rely on EMF to perform its job but we should minimize our use of EMF in this project.
This project should not have any dependency to any persistence or network-related (HTTP, Web Socket) code.
