= sirius-components-annotations

== Goal

This project provides some annotations which can be used to decorate our code.

Among those annotations, there are some dedicated to GraphQL.
They can be used to annotate some POJOs in order to create more easily our GraphQL schema.
Some parts of our GraphQL schema will be very static and they will have to look exactly as some of our POJOS.
For those specific parts of the schema, we can use a reflective approach in order to create the necessary types and fields of the schema.
This project contains the annotations to do so. 

== Dependencies
