= Spacing

The spacing component is the one to use in order to add some whitespace in the layout of a component.
It should be used for the internal layout of a component.
It also provides some constants used to ensure that all the component of the application will share some common spacing dimensions.

== Usage

In order to use the spacing component, use it with some of its four properties:

- top
- right
- bottom
- left

For each of those properties, you can use one of the values available from the component module:

- XS
- S
- M
- L
- XL
- XXL
