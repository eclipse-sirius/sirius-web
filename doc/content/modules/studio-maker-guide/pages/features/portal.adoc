= Portal

include::ROOT:partial$before-you-start-experimental-studio-maker.adoc[]

Portals let you assemble dashboards that combine multiple representations on a single page. They are ideal for onboarding users, guiding workflows, or surfacing KPI summaries.

[TIP]
====
Portal widgets reuse the same AQL variable set as the embedded representations (diagram, table, form, etc.).
Check xref:studio-maker-guide:features/aql.adoc#_built_in_variables[] if you need to know which variables are provided to each widget’s expressions.
====

== Use cases

* Provide a project landing page that highlights key diagrams, forms, and decks.
* Offer navigation shortcuts to frequently used artefacts.
* Display read-only summaries (metrics, charts) alongside actionable links.

== Portal structure

* *Sections*: columns or rows that define the layout grid.
* *Widgets*: embed existing representations (diagram, table, form, deck, Gantt, tree) or custom content (markdown, metrics, links).
* *Context providers*: determine which semantic element is passed to each widget.
* *Refresh strategy*: decide whether widgets auto-refresh when the context changes.

== Authoring steps

. Add a **Portal** description to your View model and set the semantic root (typically the project or a top-level element).
. Configure the **layout**:
.. Choose between column, row, or grid arrangements.
.. Set widths/heights and responsive rules for each section.
. Add **widgets**:
.. Reference existing representation descriptions (diagram, form, deck, etc.).
.. Inject static content (Markdown, HTML) for textual guidance.
.. Surface KPIs via charts or counters using computed AQL values.
. Define the **context** for each widget:
.. Use AQL to resolve the semantic element presented to the nested representation.
.. Optionally enable context forwarding so clicking within the portal updates other widgets.
. Provide **actions**:
.. Add buttons or links that open representations in the main editor.
.. Include quick commands triggered via services (e.g., create project artifact, launch validation).
. Test the portal to ensure widgets load quickly, context updates behave as expected, and the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

== Best practices

* Keep portals lightweight—avoid loading large diagrams or decks simultaneously unless necessary.
* Add textual guidance near widgets so end users understand what to do next.
* Use consistent color schemes and iconography to reinforce branding or workflow stages.
* Validate embedded representations independently to troubleshoot loading issues.
