= Navigate with AQL

Use this tutorial to practice the Acceleo Query Language (AQL) that powers labels, styles, filters, and tooling in {product}.

== Prerequisites

* A studio project with at least one domain and view defined.
* A sandbox project where you can open the representations and observe the effect of expressions.
* Familiarity with basic AQL syntax (attribute access, `self`, simple filters).

== Steps

. **Review the evaluation context**
.. Open the xref:user-manual:features/query-view.adoc[Query view] and select an element in your representation.
.. Evaluate simple expressions such as `self.name`, `self.eClass().name`, and `[self.eContents()->size()]` to ensure you understand the current context.
.. Note that `self` changes when you run expressions inside mappings, styles, or tools, so always confirm it before writing complex logic.
. **Add expressions to styles**
.. Pick a mapping and edit its label expression to use AQL (for example `aql:self.name.concat(' (', self.status, ')')`).
.. Configure conditional styles that switch colors or icons based on properties (`aql:self.isCritical`).
.. Refresh the representation to observe the result and iterate until the behavior matches your expectations.
. **Use AQL in other widgets**
.. Add expressions to table columns or form widgets to display computed values (counts, derived booleans, formatted strings).
.. When needed, combine filters (`select(e | e.status = 'Open')`) or aggregations (`size()`).
. **Validate complex queries**
.. Whenever you are unsure of the evaluation context, switch back to the Query view and paste the expression there first.
.. Fix errors such as “unresolved feature” or type incompatibilities before applying the expression to the representation.
. **Document your expressions**
.. Add inline comments or descriptions in the view model so future maintainers understand the intent of each AQL snippet.

== Tips

* Keep expressions small and composable; if they become unwieldy, refactor them into Java services.
* Use string helpers such as `toUpper`, `toLower`, `substring`, and `concat` to format labels consistently.
* Store frequently used expressions (status, priority, ownership) in shared mappings so you can reuse them across representations.
