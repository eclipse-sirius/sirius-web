= Create your first studio in 5 minutes

Use this end-to-end tutorial when you want to bootstrap a brand-new studio: create the domain, define the view, and validate everything in a test project.

== Prerequisites

* You can access the *Studios* area of {product}.
* You have a sample semantic project (or are willing to create one) for testing.

== Steps

. **Create the studio wrapper**
.. Open the *Studios* page and select *New Studio Project*.
.. Give it an identifier that follows your organization’s conventions (for example `com.acme.radar`).
.. Add a short description so teammates know the purpose of the studio.
. **Model the domain**
.. Inside the studio project, create a domain package.
.. Declare the main entities, attributes, and relations for your DSL.
.. Keep the structure simple at first—two or three entities are enough to validate the workflow.
.. Need a refresher? Follow xref:studio-maker-guide:hands-on/tutorials/domain.adoc[].
. **Define the view**
.. Still inside the studio project, add a view model.
.. Create at least one representation description (diagram, table, or form) and tie it to your domain entities.
.. Wire the minimal mappings and styles needed to display your semantic objects.
.. Refer to xref:studio-maker-guide:hands-on/tutorials/view.adoc[] if you need more guidance.
. **Test the studio**
.. Switch to your semantic project (or create a new one) and open a representation of the new type.
.. Exercise the palette tools, verify labels, and make sure the navigation matches your expectations.
.. Tweak the domain or view, save, and simply reopen the representation—the runtime hot-reloads the changes.
. **Iterate and share**
.. Once the studio behaves correctly, export it or package it inside your {product} distribution.
.. Share the project with colleagues so they can import it and continue refining the DSL collaboratively.

TIPS: When experimenting with complex AQL, validate expressions in the Query view before placing them in the view model.
