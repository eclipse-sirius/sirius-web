= Create your first view

This tutorial shows how to configure a view model once your domain is ready.

== Prerequisites

* A studio project that already contains the domain definitions for your DSL.
* At least one test project where you can create representations to validate the result.

== Steps

. **Open or create a studio project**
.. From the *Studios* page, create a project or reuse the one that stores your domain.
. **Add a view model**
.. Create a new View resource (this replaces the `.odesign` file from Sirius Desktop).
.. Name it after the DSL or the representation bundle (for example `DatabaseReview` or `RequirementFlow`).
. **Create the representation description**
.. Inside the view, add the representation type you need (Diagram, Table, Deck, Form, Tree, …).
.. Set the `domainType` so the runtime knows on which semantic elements users can instantiate the representation.
.. Configure the `titleExpression` and `iconExpression` that appear in tabs or launchers.
. **Map semantic elements**
.. Add mappings (nodes, edges, cards, rows, widgets) and point them to the appropriate domain entities.
.. Provide `semanticCandidatesExpression`, preconditions, and label expressions using AQL.
.. Reuse existing mappings when the same domain concept must appear in multiple contexts.
. **Style and organize the view**
.. Reference color palettes and text style palettes to keep visual consistency.
.. Add conditional styles to react to semantic state (status, priority, ownership, etc.).
. **Add tools**
.. Configure palette entries (create/delete/link) and customize the default tools if needed.
.. Combine operations and optional Java services to implement complex behaviors.
. **Test iteratively**
.. Save the view, reopen the test project, and create the representation.
.. Adjust expressions, refresh the representation, and repeat until the UI matches your expectations.

== Next steps

* When the view behaves as expected, export the studio project or package it into your {product} application.
* Continue with other representation types or move on to xref:studio-maker-guide:features/view.adoc[] for deeper customization options.
