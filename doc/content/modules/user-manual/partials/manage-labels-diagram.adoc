== Manage Labels

=== Element Label

**Keywords** on Nodes and Edges are displayed on the first separate line of the label.
For example _Definition_ nodes will be prefixed with "part def" and _Usage_ node with "part".

After the keyword, the label can be the **simple name of the element, or more complex** in some specific cases.
Indeed, For example, subset of the {sysmlv2} textual syntax is supported to describe some element.
For simple _Definition_ element, the label will display the keyword "part def" and its declared name.
For elements using _specialization_, the label will display the kind of the _specilalization_.
For example, if a _Batmobile_ is a subclassification of _Vehicle_, its label will display the key word "part def" and then "Batmobile :> Vehicle" to show its specalization toward _Vehicle_.

If _Usage_ element is given by relationship with **multiplicity**, the multiplicity value (upper and lower bound) is specified between bracket in the label, just before the specialization.
For example, for a _Batmobile_ which contained 4 _Wheel_ by using the _Usage_ _wheels_ then the label will be composed of the keyword "part" followed by the name _wheels[4] : Wheel_ which described the _Usage_ _wheels_ with multiplicity 4 defined by the _Definition_ _Wheel_.

For element with compartment node (with list layout), the label of compartment node will be displayed in _italic_ and it will only contained a simple name.

=== Edge Label

No label is defined on edges except in two cases :

* allocation edge label is specified with its keyword _allocate_,
* edge which represent relationship with multiplicity have their multiplicity defined in their label (ex.: containment edge).

=== Edit Labels

Element labels can be edited in the following ways:

* Edit action of the Palette,
* Press F2,
* Type directly the new name.

With direct edit, user can't change the keyword but user can change the name.
If it's a simple label, he can rename the element.
If user modify the multiplicity defined in the label then the multiplicity of the relationship is changed in the model.
User can alos set/change the specialization of a given element.

Label of edges and compartments node can't be edited.
