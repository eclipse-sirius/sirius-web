== Semantic Drag&Drop

Users can select elements in the Explorer view and drag and drop them into their container Nodes in the diagram.
This drag and drop doesnâ€™t perform any semantic modification.
Diagrams also allow semantic drag and drop of any element from the Explorer view (in the same resourceSet as the diagram) on the background of the diagram.

Note that it's not possible to Drag and drop an element represented as an Edge on the diagram.


== Graphical Drag&Drop

User can select a node on the diagram and drag and drop it in an other container node.
Only authorized containers are revealed on the diagram, forbidden targets are faded.
When user try to drag and drop a node, the target container node is highlighted.
