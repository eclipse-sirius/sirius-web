=  Integration and Development

Modeling rarely happens in isolation.
In real-world projects, models must interact with other tools used throughout the development lifecycle, whether for requirements management, code generation, simulation, documentation, or version control.

This section explains how {product} can be integrated with external tools and platforms.
It covers both built-in mechanisms and extension points that allow you to connect {product} to your existing toolchain.
Common integration scenarios include linking to repositories, exchanging data with other modeling tools, automating workflows, or generating artifacts.

By supporting open standards and offering extensibility at multiple levels, {product} helps you embed modeling into broader engineering environments without disrupting existing processes.
