= Form

Form-based editors in {product} provide a simple and structured way to view and edit the details of model elements.

Instead of interacting with shapes in a diagram, you work through a form made up of fields and widgetsâ€”similar to a web form.
This is especially useful when editing elements that have many properties or when diagrams are not the best way to capture information.

== What You Can Do

* View all the properties of a selected model element in one place.
* Edit text fields, select values from dropdowns, or toggle checkboxes.
* Add or remove related elements using action buttons (e.g., add a component, remove a dependency).
* Navigate between related elements using clickable links or breadcrumbs.

== When to Use It

Use the form-based editor when:

* You need to focus on the details of one element.
* The element has a lot of properties that would clutter a diagram.
* The information is best captured in a structured or tabular way.
* You want to perform quick data entry or corrections.

== Example

For a `Vehicle` element, the form might include:

* A text field for the name
* A dropdown for the engine type
* A checkbox for "is electric"
* A table listing connected components or sub-parts

Changes made in the form are immediately applied to the model and can be reflected in diagrams or other views.

[NOTE]
====
The layout and available fields in the form depend on how the modeling environment has been configured.
