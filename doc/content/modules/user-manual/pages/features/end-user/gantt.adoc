= Gantt

The Gantt in {product} allows you to view and manage time-related aspects of your model using a familiar timeline layout.

This type of representation is especially useful for planning, scheduling, and tracking activities, tasks, or events over time.

== What You Can Do

* Visualize elements (such as tasks or phases) as horizontal bars along a timeline.
* See start and end dates at a glance.
* Move or resize bars directly to adjust scheduling.
* Expand or collapse groups to focus on specific parts of the timeline.
* Hover or click on elements to view additional details.

== When to Use It

Use the Gantt when:

* You need to manage time-based or sequential information.
* You want to understand dependencies and durations visually.
* Youâ€™re planning activities, project phases, or system behaviors.
* You want to track progress over time in a structured way.

== Example

In a systems engineering project, a Gantt view might show:

* A breakdown of major development phases (e.g., Analysis, Design, Validation)
* Tasks assigned to each phase
* Time windows for each activity
* Overlaps or gaps between tasks

Changes made directly in the Gantt chart update the model and can be reflected in other views, such as diagrams or forms.

[NOTE]
====
The available features and displayed information in the Gantt view depend on how the representation has been configured.
