=== Create a New Project

The _Create New Project_ section is designed to allow users to initiate the creation of a new project.

Within the platform, initiating a new project is a user-friendly process that accommodates various preferences:

* **Create a Blank Project**: Users can start their modeling journey with an empty project, building a project from the ground up.
With blank project, there is no model and no representation at creation.
* **Create a Project from Existing Templates**: For efficiency and consistency, users can select from predefined templates that streamline project initiation, aligning with common modeling scenarios.
The 3 first possible templates are displayed unitary at the beginning of Project sections and they're also available in "Show all templates" section.
For now, there exist two available DSL templates : _Flow_ and _Papaya_.
* **Upload a Previously Exported Project**: Facilitating collaboration and workflow continuity, users can effortlessly upload a project previously exported, ensuring seamless transitions and flexibility in collaboration.
