= Deck

The *Deck* view in {product} provides a card-based interface to browse and interact with model elements.
Each element is displayed as an individual card, giving users a clean and readable layout to scan through multiple items—especially when focusing on a specific type of data.

Decks are ideal for presenting collections of similar elements, such as a list of components, tasks, stakeholders, or features, in a compact and visual way.

== What You Can Do

In a deck representation, you can:

* View multiple model elements as cards arranged in a grid or list
* Click a card to open the element in a form, diagram, or detailed view
* Filter the displayed cards based on attributes or types
* Sort or group cards (depending on configuration)
* Trigger custom actions directly from a card (e.g., mark as completed, assign to a user)

Each card typically shows key information (like name, status, icon, or color) and may include buttons or links defined by the modeling environment.

== When to Use It

Use the deck representation when:

* You need to get an overview of multiple similar elements at once
* You want a quick way to navigate to detailed editors for individual items
* A grid or list layout is more suitable than a diagram or table
* You need to scan elements visually with consistent layout and styling

Decks work well for task lists, requirements, tickets, component overviews, and any domain element with concise summaries.

== Example

A project manager might use a deck to view all project milestones as cards. Each card could display:

* The milestone title and status
* A color-coded priority indicator
* A due date
* A button to open the milestone in a form editor
* A quick-action icon to mark the milestone as “validated”

Decks provide a flexible way to navigate structured data without needing to rely on diagrams or hierarchical trees.

[NOTE]
====
The layout and contents of each card are determined by the modeling environment configuration.
Studio makers decide which properties are shown and which actions are available.
