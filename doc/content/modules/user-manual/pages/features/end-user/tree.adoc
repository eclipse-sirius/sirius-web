= Tree

The *Tree* representation in {product} displays model elements in a hierarchical structure, much like a file explorer or an outline view.

This view is particularly useful for navigating nested elements and understanding the parent-child relationships within a model.

== What You Can Do

In a tree representation, you can:

* Expand or collapse branches to explore nested structures
* Select elements to view or edit them in a form, diagram, or another representation
* Click to access contextual actions such as creating, editing, or deleting elements
* Reorganize the hierarchy (when allowed by the model configuration)

The tree provides a compact and structured way to visualize your data, making it ideal for managing hierarchical models such as system breakdowns, component structures, functional trees, or requirement hierarchies.

== When to Use It

Use the tree representation when:

* You want to browse through hierarchical relationships between elements
* You need to find and open a specific element in a complex structure
* A graphical layout would be too space-consuming or hard to read
* Youâ€™re working with models that follow nested or parent-child structures

Trees are often used alongside other representations like diagrams or forms to provide a consistent and navigable entry point into the model.

== Example

In a systems engineering model, the tree might be used to display a breakdown of system components, like:

* System
** Subsystem A
*** Component A1
*** Component A2
** Subsystem B
*** Component B1

Clicking on a component in the tree can open a form to edit its properties or a diagram to view its structure.

[NOTE]
====
The hierarchy and available actions depend on how the tree representation is configured in your modeling environment.
