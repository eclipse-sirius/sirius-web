= Diagram

In {product}, diagrams offer an interactive and visual way to work with your models.

image:diagram.png[]

They let you create, view, and edit elements and relationships graphically, helping you understand the structure and behavior of your system at a glance.

Diagrams are generated based on predefined rules created by studio makers.
As an end user, you don’t have to configure them—you simply use them to capture and organize domain-specific information using the visual tools provided.

== What You Can Do

When you open a diagram, you'll see model elements (such as components, links, containers, etc.) displayed as graphical shapes.
You can:

* Add new elements using the palette
* Move, resize, and connect items
* Edit labels and properties
* Use zoom and layout controls to explore large models
* Interact with the model in ways that are constrained by domain-specific logic

All your changes are automatically reflected in the underlying model and synchronized with other views like tables or forms.

=== Global Palette

The global palette provides general tools for navigating and managing the diagram as a whole.

[cols="10%,20%,70%", options="header"]
|===
| | Tool | What it does

a|image::global-palette-full-screen.png[Full screen]
| Full screen
| Opens the diagram in full-screen mode for distraction-free modeling.

a|image::global-palette-fit-to-screen.png[Fit to screen]
| Fit to screen
| Adjusts the zoom level to ensure all elements or the current selection fit within the visible area.

a|image::global-palette-zoom.png[Zoom]
| Zoom
| Lets you zoom in and out manually using the toolbar buttons.

a|image::global-palette-share.png[Share]
| Share
| Generates a shareable link to the current diagram.

a|image::global-palette-export.png[Export]
| Export SVG
| Downloads the current view of the diagram as an SVG, HTML SVG or PNG image.

a|image::global-palette-snap-to-grid.png[Snap to grid]
| Snap to grid
| Helps align elements precisely by snapping them to an invisible grid during movement or resizing.

a|image::global-palette-helper-lines.png[Helper lines]
| Helper lines
| Displays visual guides when dragging elements to assist with alignment.

a|image::global-palette-arrange-all.png[Arrange all]
| Arrange all
| Automatically reorganizes all elements to improve overall layout clarity.

a|image::global-palette-smart-edges.png[Smart Edges]
| Smart Edges
| Enables edge routing that avoids crossing nodes (experimental, client-side only, not saved).

a|image::global-palette-show.png[Show hidden elements]
| Show hidden elements
| Reveals hidden edges, nodes, or other visual components.

a|image::global-palette-unfade.png[Unfade elements]
| Unfade elements
| Restores full visibility to elements that were faded.

a|image::global-palette-unpin.png[Unpin elements]
| Unpin elements
| Allows previously pinned elements to be moved freely again.

a|image::global-palette-filter.png[Filter]
| Filter
| Applies visual filters to focus on elements matching specific attributes or types.
|===

TIP: You can combine Arrange All, Helper Lines, and Snap to Grid to quickly clean up complex diagrams.

NOTE: Smart Edges is experimental. It only affects the local view and is not saved with the model.

=== Contextual Palette (Right-Click)

When you *right-click* on an element in a diagram, a *contextual palette* appears.
It offers quick access to actions you can apply to the selected element—or to a group of elements if you've selected several.

image::contextual-palette.png[]

Unlike the global palette, which offers tools for managing the entire diagram, the contextual palette adapts to your selection—showing tools specific to nodes, containers, edges, or other elements.

==== How to Use

. Right-click on any element in the diagram (e.g., a node, connection, or container).
. A palette appears next to the selected element.
. Click any of the available actions to perform the desired task.

==== Actions on single element

|===
| | Tool | What it does

a|image::contextual-palette-create-element.png[Create element]
| *Create element*
| Add a new child or related element (e.g., create a sub-component).

a|image::contextual-palette-create-connection.png[Create element]
| *Create connection*
| Add a new child or related element (e.g., create a connection).

a|image::contextual-palette-delete-from-model.png[Delete from model]
| *Delete from model*
| Remove the selected element from the model.

a|image::contextual-palette-delete-from-diagram.png[Delete from diagram]
| *Delete from diagram*
| Remove the selected element from the diagram.

a|image::contextual-palette-edit.png[Edit]
| *Collapse*
| Lets you rename the element or change its properties directly in the diagram.

a|image::contextual-palette-edit.png[Edit]
| *Edit*
| Lets you rename the element or change its properties directly in the diagram.

a|image::contextual-palette-hide.png[Hide]
| *Hide*
| Temporarily removes the element from view. You can show it again later using the global palette.

a|image::contextual-palette-fade.png[Fade]
| *Fade*
| Makes the element appear dimmed so it’s less distracting, without hiding it completely.

a|image::contextual-palette-pin.png[Pin]
| *Pin*
| Locks the element in place so it doesn’t move when rearranging the diagram.

a|image::contextual-palette-reconnect.png[Reconnect]
| *Reconnect*
| Change the source or target of a connection or relationship.

a|image::contextual-palette-adjust-size.png[Adjust size]
| *Adjust size*
| Automatically resizes the element to fit its content.

a|image::contextual-palette-custom-tools.png[Custom tools]
| *Custom tools*
| Domain-specific actions defined by the studio maker (e.g., _Mark as Deprecated_, _Duplicate_, etc.).
|===

[NOTE]
====
The tools available in the contextual palette are defined by the studio maker and may vary depending on the domain and representation configuration.
====

[TIP]
====
You can also use keyboard shortcuts or the details panel to perform some actions.
====

==== Actions on Multiple Elements

When you select multiple elements (e.g., by holding _Shift_ and dragging a selection box), the palette shows tools for organizing and aligning the selection.

[TIP]
====
To select multiple elements:

* Hold *`Shift` and drag* with the left mouse button to draw a rectangular selection zone.
* Or hold *`Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on Mac) and click* individual elements to add or remove them from the selection.

== When to Use It

Use the diagram representation when:

* You want to visualize the structure or composition of a system.
* You prefer a graphical layout to better understand relationships between elements.
* You need to create or edit models in a spatial, drag-and-drop interface.
* You’re working on system design, architecture, workflows, or any visual representation of domain logic.

== Example

In a system modeling context, a diagram might show:

* Components and their relationships (e.g., a `Sensor`, `Controller`, and `Actuator`)
* Nested structures like subsystems or containers
* Connections such as communication links or data flows
* Visual cues based on domain rules (e.g., a red border around components with missing links)

This visual approach helps engineers and domain experts understand the system at a glance and make informed modeling decisions quickly.

[NOTE]
====
The layout and available elements in the diagram depend on how the modeling
environment has been configured.
