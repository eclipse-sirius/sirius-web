= Portal

The *Portal* in {product} acts as a customizable landing page or entry point into your project.
It provides a structured, high-level overview of the model and can serve as a dashboard to guide users toward important areas or actions.

Each portal is designed by studio makers to present a custom view composed of multiple existing representations, such as diagrams, forms, Gantt, and more.

== What You Can Do

In a portal representation, you can:

* View high-level summaries of your project or system
* Access important elements or representations directly
* Navigate to frequently used forms, diagrams, tables, or trees

The portal is read-only in most cases, but interactive elements are available based on the configuration.

== When to Use It

Use the portal representation when:

* You want a guided entry point into the model
* You need quick access to key representations or data
* Youâ€™re unfamiliar with the structure and want to orient yourself
* The project defines a custom workflow and you want to follow the suggested steps

Portals are ideal for simplifying onboarding, standardizing modeling processes, or surfacing key actions for users in complex projects.

== Example

In a project context, a portal might display:

* The project name and description
* The system diagram
* A form to create a new subsystem
* A summary of key metrics or project status

This gives users a structured, user-friendly overview to help them get started quickly and navigate the model with confidence.

[NOTE]
====
The layout and available actions in the portal are defined by studio makers and may vary between projects or domains.
