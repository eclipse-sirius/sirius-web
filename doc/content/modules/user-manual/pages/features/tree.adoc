= Tree

include::ROOT:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

The *Tree* representation in {product} displays model elements in a hierarchical structure, much like a file explorer or an outline view.

This view is particularly useful for navigating nested elements and understanding the parent-child relationships within a model.

== What You Can Do

In a tree representation, you can:

* Expand or collapse branches to explore nested structures
* Select elements to view or edit them in a form, diagram, or another representation
* Click to access contextual actions such as creating, editing, or deleting elements
* Reorganize the hierarchy (when allowed by the model configuration)

The tree provides a compact and structured way to visualize your data, making it ideal for managing hierarchical models such as system breakdowns, component structures, functional trees, or requirement hierarchies.

== When to Use It

Use the tree representation when:

* You want to browse through hierarchical relationships between elements
* You need to find and open a specific element in a complex structure
* A graphical layout would be too space-consuming or hard to read
* You’re working with models that follow nested or parent-child structures

Trees are often used alongside other representations like diagrams or forms to provide a consistent and navigable entry point into the model.

== Example

In a systems engineering model, the tree might be used to display a breakdown of system components, like:

* System
** Subsystem A
*** Component A1
*** Component A2
** Subsystem B
*** Component B1

Clicking on a component in the tree can open a form to edit its properties or a diagram to view its structure.

=== Filtering and synchronization

When contributed to the editor’s sidebar, trees typically expose toolbar controls:

* *Filter bar*: highlight or narrow the visible nodes based on names, types, or other attributes provided by the current representation.
* *Sync toggle*: keep the tree selection aligned with the active editor element, or disable it to explore the hierarchy independently.

These controls mirror the ones available in the default Explorer, so switching between representations feels familiar.

=== Replacing the Explorer

Studios can contribute a tree representation directly to the left sidebar, replacing or complementing the standard Explorer. This is useful when your domain needs a custom hierarchy or virtual nodes that differ from the semantic model. When authorized, drag-and-drop reorganizes the hierarchy, allowing you to refactor the model structure straight from the tree.

[NOTE]
====
The hierarchy and available actions depend on how the tree representation is configured in your modeling environment.
