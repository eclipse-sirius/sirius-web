= Parametric modeling and constraints

{sysmlv2} still use ports to define connection points on parts but Interconnection View diagrams to manage part input parameters in comparison to {sysmlv1}.

In the {iv} diagram, users can create ports with a defined direction or not thanks to the contextual palette of a part.
To represent data flow between ports, user can create either `InterfaceUsage` or `BindingConnector as usage` when he's connecting two ports between them.
These data flows visually represent how parameter values relate to each other, allowing their propagation through the model.
