For a more focused exploration, delve into the {related-elements} view.

This feature offers a contextual perspective on the selected element by organizing references into three tabs:

* *Incoming*: elements that point to the current selection. Follow these links to understand which parts of the system depend on it.
* *Outgoing*: elements that the selection references. Use this to inspect downstream impact or to open related artefacts quickly.
* *Current*: parents, children, or other structural relationships that place the element within its broader hierarchy.

Click any entry to navigate directly to that element in the editor. Cross-domain links appear when your project contains models from different domains; the view helps you understand those relationships without switching representations.
