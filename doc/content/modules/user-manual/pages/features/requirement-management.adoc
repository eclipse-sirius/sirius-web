= Requirements management and traceability

== Creating and linking requirements

By using {product}, requirements can be well integrated and defined  with the {gv}.
Remember that a requirement is a kind of constraint representing the constraints given by stakeholders that a solution must satisfy.
For example, the requirement of a maximum speed of a vehicle.
From the {gv} diagram, user can create a new requirement **from the background** of the diagram from a click that displays toolbar.

User can also create requirement **in other element** such as a requirement.

A Requirement Definition is represented by rectangular node style whereas a Requirement Usage is represented by rectangular node style with rounded corner.

For now, {gv} diagram authorize only to create requirement Definition and Usage.
_Satisfy_ relationship to define connection between requirements aren't available.
Work around requirements are among the topics to be processed soon.
