= Collaborative modeling

Various solutions exist for collaborating with {product}.
Explore different collaboration methods to enhance your teamwork and communication within {product}.

* *Share Projects, Models, Diagrams*: Collaborating in {product} is a breeze with the ability to xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/project-management.adoc#share-project[share projects], models, and xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/representation-operations.adoc#share-representation[diagrams]. Sharing projects and models is as simple as providing a link, similar to the process of sharing diagrams.
* xref:developer-guide:interoperability.adoc[*Exchange* Projects or Models].

== Sharing links and permissions

include::ROOT:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

Every project page exposes a *Share* action.
Copy the generated link and send it to teammates who already have access to the same workspace.

TIP: Use descriptive link titles when sending them to collaborators so everyone understands the context (for example, “Review the Architecture diagram in Sprint 5”).

== Working together in real time

include::ROOT:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

{product} keeps model changes synchronized for all connected users. When someone edits a property, adds a node, or rearranges a representation, the update is pushed to other clients automatically.
Coordinate over voice/video or a chat tool and stay mindful of the shared model: avoid editing the exact same element simultaneously unless your environment defines explicit locking.

== Exchanging data with other tools

If teammates do not have access to your environment, export a project archive and share it via your preferred channel. The recipient can upload the archive to their own workspace and continue modeling. See xref:developer-guide:interoperability.adoc[] for workflows that bridge {product} with other systems.

== Version control recommendations

For long-lived collaborations or regulated domains, download project snapshots regularly and store them in an external version control system such as Git.
Refer to xref:features/cm.adoc[] for guidance on building an audit trail outside {product}.
