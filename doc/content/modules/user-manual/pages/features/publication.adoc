In {product}, the mechanism that allows users to turn a xref:user-manual:concepts.adoc#project[project] into a xref:user-manual:concepts.adoc#library[Library] is called *Publication*.
Publishing libraries is the way to define dependencies between projects.

By default, publishing a project can be done by using the dedicated command from the command palette.

Note that it is only available for projects with documents containing SysML elements as their root contents.
The publication process only publishes the SysML contents.

Upon selecting this command, a dialog prompts for the library information.

The project name will be used as the library name, and the project ID will be used as the library namespace.

When the publication is successful, a success notification appears.
Otherwise, an error notification appears, e.g. when trying to publish a library with a namespace, name and version that already exists.

After publication, the library is listed alongside xref:user-manual:concepts.adoc#library[the other published libraries].
