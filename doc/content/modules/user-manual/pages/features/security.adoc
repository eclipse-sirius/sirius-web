= Security and compliance

== Security
{product} does'nt inherently implement any security features or compliance measures directly within the product.
However, we understand that security and regulatory compliance are critical concerns for our users.
If you are interested in how these topics can be addressed or have specific security and compliance requirements, please feel free to xref:ROOT:help.adoc[contact us] for further discussion and tailored solutions.

* Authentication and Authorization: While {product} does'nt include built-in mechanisms for authentication or authorization, we recognize the importance of secure user management.
We can offer guidance on integrating {product} with external authentication systems, including Single Sign-On (SSO).
* Data Encryption: {product} itself does'nt offer encryption for data at rest or in transit.
We can discuss potential approaches to secure data handling, including leveraging external encryption services or tools to protect sensitive information.
* Audit Logging and Monitoring: Although {product} does'nt feature built-in logging or monitoring capabilities, we can assist you in setting up external tools to track user activities, monitor system performance, and support logs for security audits.
* Data Integrity and Backup: {product} does'nt offer specific mechanisms for ensuring data integrity or performing backups.
If these are critical for your use case, we're available to help you explore and integrate appropriate third-party solutions for data integrity checks and backup processes.
* Secure Development Practices: While {product} does'nt enforce secure coding standards or vulnerability management practices, we can offer advice and recommendations on best practices for secure software development and maintenance.

== Compliance

{product} is dedicated to aligning with industry standards to ensure interoperability, flexibility, and future-proofing for our users.
A key aspect of this commitment is our focus on compliance with the {sysmlv2} standard from the Object Management Group (OMG).

The Systems Modeling Language ({sysml}) is a widely recognized standard used for modeling complex systems.
{sysmlv2} represents the next evolution of this standard, aiming to offer enhanced capabilities for systems engineering and {mbse} (MBSE).

{product} is committed to being compliant with the {sysmlv2} standard as soon as it's officially defined and released by the OMG.
Our development team is closely monitoring the progress of the {sysmlv2} standardization process.
