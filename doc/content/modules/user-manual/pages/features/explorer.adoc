include::ROOT:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

The {explorer} presents a hierarchical view of all models and their contents within the project, displayed as a tree structure with expandable and collapsible items.

* *Models*: Represented by the models existing in the specific project.
* *Semantic Elements*: Located within the models, these are instances of your business domain concepts, each with its own set of children.
* *Representations*: If a particular semantic element has an associated representation, such as a diagram, it appears as a child of the semantic element.

== {explorer} Toolbar

At the top of the {explorer}, a toolbar provides quick access to essential actions:

* xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#create-model[Add a Model]: Enables the creation of a new model within the project.
* xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#upload-model[Upload a Model]: Allows users to upload and integrate an external model into the project.
* xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/explorer.adoc#sync-editor[Synchronize Editor] with Explorer: Ensures alignment between the explorer view and the editor, providing a seamless and up-to-date navigation experience.

Depending on the configuration, additional controls let you:

* Choose alternative tree structures (for example, display semantic hierarchy or group by representations).
* Toggle synchronization with the active editor selection.
* Open filter panels that focus on specific item types or names.

== Selection

Users can select any item in the {explorer}:

* Selecting a *Semantic Element*: Displays its properties in the xref:features/details.adoc[Details] view.
If that element already appears in an open representation, the matching shape (node or edge in a diagram for example) is highlighted there, and becomes the active selection in the editor.
* Selecting a *Representation*: Opens it in a new tab or focuses on an existing tab where it was already open.

== {explorer-menu}

The *{explorer-menu}* (three-dots More menu) offers a set of relevant actions depending on the nature of the selected item.
This menu provides functionalities based on the selected item:

* For Models (Root Elements), users can:
** xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#create-model[Create a new model].
** xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#create-element[Create a new child element].
** xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#download-model[Download the model].

** xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#rename-model[Rename the model].
** xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#delete-model[Delete the model].
* For Semantic Elements, users can:
** xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#create-element[Create a new child element].
** xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/representation-operations.adoc#create-representation[Create a new representation].
** xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/explorer.adoc#expand-all[Expand all the children].
** xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#rename-element[Rename the element].
** xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/model-management.adoc#delete-element[Delete the element].

** xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/representation-operations.adoc#rename-representation[Rename the representation].
** xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/representation-operations.adoc#delete-representation[Delete the representation].

== {explorer-filter-bar}

The *{explorer-filter-bar}* in the {explorer} view provides the capability to highlight and xref:user-manual:hands-on/how-tos/explorer.adoc#filter-explorer[filter tree items].
You can stack several filters (by name, type, or tag) and clear them when you want to restore the full model view.

== Drag and Drop

Users can drag and drop semantic elements into another semantic target.
This action will move the elements and their owning memberships to the selected target.

In some cases, a warning will be displayed advising that the drag and drop operation is forbidden for semantic or technical reasons.
For example, dragging to or from a _read-only_ library is forbidden.
