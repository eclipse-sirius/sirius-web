The {validation} view displays diagnostics for the entire project, organized by their kind such as `ERROR`, `WARNING`, or `INFO`.
Users can expand or collapse each severity group using the accordion to focus on critical issues first. Clicking a diagnostic highlights the associated element elsewhere in the editor so you can correct it immediately.

TIP: Some configurations provide a *Re-run validation* command in the toolbar or command palette. Trigger it after making fixes to refresh the list without leaving the editor.
