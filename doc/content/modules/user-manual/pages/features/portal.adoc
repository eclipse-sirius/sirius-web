= Portal

The *Portal* in {product} acts as a customizable landing page or entry point into your project.
It provides a structured, high-level overview of the model and can serve as a dashboard to guide users toward important areas or actions.

Each portal is preconfigured to present a custom view composed of multiple existing representations, such as diagrams, forms, Gantt, and more.

== What You Can Do

In a portal representation, you can:

* View high-level summaries of your project or system
* Access important elements or representations directly
* Navigate to frequently used forms, diagrams, tables, or trees

The portal is read-only in most cases, but interactive elements are available based on the configuration.

== When to Use It

Use the portal representation when:

* You want a guided entry point into the model
* You need quick access to key representations or data
* You’re unfamiliar with the structure and want to orient yourself
* The project defines a custom workflow and you want to follow the suggested steps

Portals are ideal for simplifying onboarding, standardizing modeling processes, or surfacing key actions for users in complex projects.

== Example

In a project context, a portal might display:

* The project name and description
* The system diagram
* A form to create a new subsystem
* A summary of key metrics or project status

This gives users a structured, user-friendly overview to help them get started quickly and navigate the model with confidence.

[NOTE]
====
The layout and available actions in the portal depend on how it was configured and may vary between projects or domains.

== Creating and configuring a portal

If portals are enabled on your instance (default), any user can create one:

. In the Explorer, right-click a semantic element and select *New representation*.
. Choose *Portal* as the type, give it a name, and confirm.
. The portal opens in *portal edition mode* so you can add content immediately.

An empty portal looks like this:

Drag any existing representation from the Explorer onto the portal canvas to embed it:

You can move, resize, or remove embedded frames while the portal is in edition mode:

image::representations/portal-add.png[Add], image::representations/portal-resize.png[Resize], image::representations/portal-move.png[Move], image::representations/portal-remove.png[Remove]

== Edition mode vs representation mode

A portal operates in two modes:

* *Portal edition mode* (pen icon): configure the layout, add/remove representations, move frames.
* *Representation edition mode* (hand icon): interact normally with the embedded representations while the layout stays fixed.

Use the toolbar buttons to switch modes at any time.
A newly created or empty portal always starts in edition mode.
