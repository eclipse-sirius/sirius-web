= Deck

include::ROOT:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

The *Deck* view in {product} provides a card-based interface to browse and interact with model elements.
Each element is displayed as an individual card, giving users a clean and readable layout to scan through multiple items—especially when focusing on a specific type of data.

Decks are ideal for presenting collections of similar elements, such as a list of components, tasks, stakeholders, or features, in a compact and visual way.

== What You Can Do

In a deck representation, you can:

* View multiple model elements as cards arranged in a grid or list
* Click a card to open the element in a form, diagram, or detailed view
* Filter the displayed cards based on attributes or types
* Sort or group cards (depending on configuration)
* Trigger custom actions directly from a card (e.g., mark as completed, assign to a user)
* Drag cards between lanes to reflect status changes or reorganize work
* Use multi-selection to align, distribute, or batch-edit cards that share the same lane

Each card typically shows key information (like name, status, icon, or color) and may include buttons or links defined by the modeling environment.

=== Lane and card actions

Decks provide contextual tools for both lanes and cards:

* *Lane headers*: rename the lane, create a new card, toggle all cards visible or hidden, and remove cards you no longer need.
* *Cards*: edit the title, label, or description in place (press `F2` to focus the title and `Tab` to move between editable fields); hide or reveal individual cards; trigger domain-specific commands when they are available.
* *Drag and drop*: rearrange the order of lanes or move a card to another lane to update its status. When enabled by the configuration, the same card can appear in multiple lanes to surface cross-cutting work.

TIP: Hold `Shift` and drag to lasso-select several cards. A contextual palette appears so you can align or distribute them consistently.

=== Deck toolbar

image::representations/deck-toolbar.png[Deck toolbar]

Use the toolbar at the top of the deck to:

* Toggle full-screen mode.
* Zoom in/out, reset the zoom, or fit the entire board to the viewport.
* Generate a shareable link that opens the same deck and selection.

These controls mirror the ones you see on diagrams, so navigation remains consistent across representations.

=== Show or hide cards

Every lane header exposes an expand/collapse action and individual cards provide a hide toggle.
Use them to focus on the items that matter without deleting the underlying elements.

=== Global palette

Decks reuse the navigation tools available in other representations:

* *Full screen* for distraction-free editing.
* *Fit to screen* and *Zoom* to adjust the view.
* *Share* to generate a link to the current deck.

Depending on your configuration, additional options such as *Filter* or *Export* may appear alongside these core actions.

== When to Use It

Use the deck representation when:

* You need to get an overview of multiple similar elements at once
* You want a quick way to navigate to detailed editors for individual items
* A grid or list layout is more suitable than a diagram or table
* You need to scan elements visually with consistent layout and styling

Decks work well for task lists, requirements, tickets, component overviews, and any domain element with concise summaries.

== Example

A project manager might use a deck to view all project milestones as cards. Each card could display:

* The milestone title and status
* A color-coded priority indicator
* A due date
* A button to open the milestone in a form editor
* A quick-action icon to mark the milestone as “validated”

Decks provide a flexible way to navigate structured data without needing to rely on diagrams or hierarchical trees.

[NOTE]
====
The layout and contents of each card are determined by the modeling environment configuration.
Which properties are shown and which actions are available depends on that configuration.
