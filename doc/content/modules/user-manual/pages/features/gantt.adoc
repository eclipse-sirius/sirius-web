= Gantt

include::ROOT:partial$before-you-start-experimental-all.adoc[]

The Gantt in {product} allows you to view and manage time-related aspects of your model using a familiar timeline layout.

This type of representation is especially useful for planning, scheduling, and tracking activities, tasks, or events over time.

== What You Can Do

* Visualize elements (such as tasks or phases) as horizontal bars along a timeline.
* See start and end dates at a glance.
* Move or resize bars directly to adjust scheduling.
* Expand or collapse groups to focus on specific parts of the timeline.
* Hover or click on elements to view additional details.
* Create and adjust dependencies between tasks to highlight sequencing constraints.

== When to Use It

Use the Gantt when:

* You need to manage time-based or sequential information.
* You want to understand dependencies and durations visually.
* You’re planning activities, project phases, or system behaviors.
* You want to track progress over time in a structured way.

== Example

In a systems engineering project, a Gantt view might show:

* A breakdown of major development phases (e.g., Analysis, Design, Validation)
* Tasks assigned to each phase
* Time windows for each activity
* Overlaps or gaps between tasks, including their dependencies

Changes made directly in the Gantt chart update the model and can be reflected in other views, such as diagrams or forms.

TIP: Hover a bar to reveal start/end dates and completion ratios. Drag either end to reschedule, or draw a dependency between tasks to reflect the order of execution.

EXAMPLE: Use the *Task* project template and open the “Daily Project Dev” Gantt to explore linked tasks, milestones, and drag-to-reschedule interactions in a ready-made dataset.

[NOTE]
====
The available features and displayed information in the Gantt view depend on how the representation has been configured.

== Task types and dependencies

Gantt supports three task types:

image::representations/gantt-task.png[Task]; image::representations/gantt-task-group.png[Group]; image::representations/gantt-task-milestone.png[Milestone]

* *Basic tasks* with start/end dates and completion percentage (the filled portion of the bar).
* *Group tasks* containing subtasks; their dates and progress can either be computed from children or defined manually.
* *Milestones* that represent a specific date.

Dependencies appear as arrows between tasks:

Use the circular handles on each task to create or remove relations.

== Toolbar and navigation

image::representations/gantt-toolbar.png[Gantt toolbar]

The toolbar provides:

* Full screen toggle.
* Zoom level (Hour, Half-day, Day, Two days, Week, Month, Year).
* Zoom in/out and fit-to-screen.
* Column visibility menu.
* Share link.

== Editing tasks

Use the handles on a task bar to change the start or end date, or drag the entire bar to shift the task:

Dragging the center adjusts the progress.
Dates snap according to the rounding expression defined by the specifier.

Create dependencies via the round connector next to each task:

Contextual palettes let you create/delete tasks or dependencies quickly:

image::representations/gantt-task-palette.png[Task palette]; image::representations/gantt-task-dependency-palette.png[Dependency palette]

Tasks can also be reordered or reparented from the table:

== Table pane

The table on the left mirrors the hierarchy of tasks.
You can expand/collapse rows (the state is persisted) and resize columns—column widths are remembered per representation.
The toolbar’s column selector hides or shows additional data columns as needed.
