== Version and release policies

{product} adheres to a CalVer - Calendar Versioning - strategy to communicate the timeline and stability of its releases.
The versioning follows a `YEAR.MONTH.PATCH` format, where:

* `YEAR.MONTH.0`: These are the stable releases, marking significant milestones or major updates.
For example, a version such as 2024.5.0 indicates a stable release from May 2024.
* Intermediate Releases: Between the .0 versions, there might be several intermediate releases, denoted by increasing the `PATCH` number, for example 2024.5.1, 2024.5.2.
These are intended to provide updates, fixes, and incremental improvements leading up to the next stable release.

Stable versions - `.0` versions are recommended for production environments, while intermediate versions offer early access to new features and fixes but might undergo further changes before the next stable release.

This strategy ensures that users can rely on a predictable and transparent update cycle, aligning with the continuous evolution and enhancement of {product}.
