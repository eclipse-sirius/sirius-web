= Installation Architecture

Before diving into the installation process, it's crucial to understand the underlying architecture of {product}.
This section provides a detailed overview of the system's components, their interactions, and the overall design principles.

{product} is a _web application_, meaning it runs centrally on a server, and users interact with it through web browsers from any computer on the same network.

There is one primary method for installing {product}, following the classical client-server model:

* The server computer runs the {product} Server,
* N client computers run the {product} Clients.
