[#server-req]
== Server-side installation requirements

To set up the {product} Server, it's crucial to meet the specific prerequisites that lay the groundwork for a stable and reliable server environment.

[%noheader]
|===
|*Hardware*
a|* For a small number of projects, less or equal to 10, and about 10-30 users, 100k semantic elements and 1000 representations in total: a recent server featuring a multi-core CPU clocked at 2 GHz and equipped with 4 GB of available RAM, along with a reasonably fast hard drive, 7200 Revolutions Per Minute - `RPM` or faster, should cater for your needs.
** Required RAM: 4 GB
** Recommended RAM *8 GB* or more
** Required CPU: Dual-core processor
** Recommended CPU: *Quad-core* processor
** Disk space: *10 GB* for installation
** *Supplementary disk* space for application data

* To enhance performance further, it's advisable to follow {product} memory usage and assign more memory as needed.
In scenarios where your system anticipates a large volume of concurrent requests, deploying {product} applications on a multi-core CPU machine becomes helpful.
This strategy increases the concurrency of processing requests, leading to improved response times for your users.
Adjusting memory allocation and leveraging multi-core capabilities contribute to optimizing the all system responsiveness.
For more information, you can also see xref:user-manual:features/end-user/scaling-limits.adoc[Scaling {product}].

|*Operating system*
a|{product} operates purely on Java and should function on any supported operating system, given that it meets the JDK / JRE requirements.

* Linux 64-bit, preferable distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
* Windows Server 64-bit, recommended versions include Windows Server 2016 or later : xref:anti-virus.adoc[Read antivirus] in {product} applications.
|*Database*
a|To connect your {product} instance to an enterprise database, you must install and configure one of the following supported databases:

* *PostgreSQL 15*

Verify that the server has a dedicated PostgreSQL database with administrator rights.

|*Java Runtime Environment - `JRE`*
a|You need to install and configure a separate JRE to run {product}, you have to install a supported version of the Java runtime:

* Use *Java 17* to run the {product} Server.

It's recommended to use the Java runtime provided by the https://adoptium.net/fr/temurin/releases/[Eclipse Temurin] project.

|*Network Connectivity*
|Stable internet connection for updates and communication with {product} Clients.
|===

[#client-req]
== Client-side installation requirements

{product} is browser-based software, which means you can run {product} on all full desktop operating systems : `MacOS`, `Windows`, `Linux`, or `Chrome OS`.

=== Supported browsers

Users can interact with the central server through following web browsers:

[%noheader]
|===
a|*Desktop browsers:*

* *Chrome* latest stable version
* *Mozilla Firefox* latest stable version
a|*Mobile browsers:*

Note that {product} isn't supported on mobile devices.
|===

WARNING: {product} doesn't support Internet Explorer.

[NOTE]
====
{product} supports a minimal screen resolution of 1024 * 768 with maximized browsers.
====

=== Supported operating system

The minimal operating system - `OS` requirements are:

* Windows 10 or later
* Apple macOS 13.x Ventura and later
* Any Linux operating system that supports the browsers mentioned earlier

[NOTE]
====
You can find out what browser and operating system version you have on https://www.whatsmybrowser.org/[What's my Browser].
====

[CAUTION]
====
A plugin, add-on, or extension that you have installed in your browser could cause speed, upload, download, or various interface problem with {product}.
To see if this is the case you can try disabling all plugins, add-ons, or extensions within your browser.

== Deployment recommendations

=== Latency

You should aim to offer a network with the lowest possible latency between the client and the server.

=== Server and database latency

To get optimal performance, it's strongly recommend hosting both the server and database on the same physical server to reduce latency between the two components.

=== Network stability

Virtual Private Network - `VPN` aren't recommended.
It's a common latency factor such as other network elements that could drop connections that are more or less inactive.
As such wireless connection are also not recommended as any loss of connectivity might lead to instability in the product and loss of data.
If a network element of this kind is mandatory, use an SSH tunnel as a workaround to avoid client/server disconnections.

=== Server isolation

{product} should be the unique way to edit the information stored in the database.

== Disclaimer

{product} isn't warranted to run without any error or interruption.
We don't make any warranty about the statements that are under the section <<Deployment recommendations>>, it's for information purposes.

You acknowledge and accept the risks involved by using these products that could include without limitation, downtime, loss of connectivity or data, system crashes, bad performances or performance degradation.
