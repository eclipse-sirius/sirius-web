= Local installation of {product} for single-user testing purposes

Use this guide to spin up a local {product} instance for evaluation or workshops.
It relies on Docker to provide the PostgreSQL database and mirrors the steps commonly used in trainings.

[CAUTION]
.Stable versions
====
Only `YEAR.MONTH.0` releases are supported outside of test environments.
Intermediate versions are meant for experimentation and can change without notice, so always pick the `.0` tag for evaluation or demos you share with others.
See xref:user-manual:cycle.adoc[] for the release cycle details.
====

== Prerequisites

Make sure your workstation satisfies the xref:installation-guide:requirements.adoc[hardware prerequisites] and that the following tools are installed:

* Java 17 (JDK). Verify with:
+
```bash
java -version
```
* Docker Desktop or Engine, so you can run a PostgreSQL container.
* Network access to download the sample application and container images.

TIP: If you already have PostgreSQL 15 or newer installed locally, you can reuse it instead of Docker. Adjust the connection parameters accordingly.

== Start PostgreSQL with Docker

[source,bash]
----
docker run -p 5433:5432 --name sirius-web-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpwd \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=sirius-web-db \
  -d postgres:15
----

This command:

* Maps container port `5432` to `5433` on your machine.
* Creates a `dbuser`/`dbpwd` account and a `sirius-web-db` database.
* Runs PostgreSQL 15 in the background.

Add `--rm` if you want Docker to remove the container automatically when it stops.

Stop the container when you are done testing:

```bash
docker stop sirius-web-postgres
```

== Launch the sample application

Download the sample `{product-jar}` from the xref:installation-guide:how-tos/install/production_deploy.adoc#download[packages page], then run:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar sirius-web-sample-application.jar \
  --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5433/sirius-web-db \
  --spring.datasource.username=dbuser \
  --spring.datasource.password=dbpwd
----

The application starts on `http://localhost:8080` by default. Keep the terminal open so you can stop the server with `Ctrl+C` when you finish testing.

== Next steps

* Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to reach the {homepage}.
* Create a blank project or import one of the templates to explore the studio features.
* When you are ready for multi-user or production deployments, move on to xref:installation-guide:how-tos/install/production_deploy.adoc[] for SSL, scaling, and hardening guidance.

[CAUTION]
====
Remember to stop both the Java process (`Ctrl+C`) and the PostgreSQL container (or your native database service) when you finish a session.
If you used Docker volumes only, removing the container also deletes all data created during testing.
