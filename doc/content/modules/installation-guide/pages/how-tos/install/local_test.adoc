= Local installation of {product} for single-user testing purposes

Follow these instructions to install a local version of the application, intended for testing purposes.
This setup is configured for use by the local user only and doesn't include any security configurations.

== Get {product}

[CAUTION]
.Stable versions
====
Only `YEAR.MONTH.0` versions are stable and suitable for production deployments.
Other versions, such as intermediate releases, are intended solely for testing purposes.
They're not recommended for production use due to their potential for further changes and instability.
Always use the stable `.0` releases for any production environments to ensure reliability and support.
For more details see xref:user-manual:cycle.adoc[].

[#docker-install]
== Deploy {product} with Docker

The easiest way to deploy {product} is by running it alongside a PostgreSQL database in Docker.

[NOTE]
====
Before you proceed with the installation, confirm you have the following xref:requirements.adoc[Hardware prerequisites]:

* https://www.docker.com/[Docker] installed and running.
Docker is required for running the PostgreSQL container.
Download it from Dockerâ€™s official site.
Alternatively, if you already have PostgreSQL 15 or later installed, you can use it instead of Docker.
* https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/[Java 17] installed and running.
You can download it from the Adoptium website.
====

=== Step 1: Start PostgreSQL Using Docker

Run the following command to start a PostgreSQL container locally:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -p 5433:5432 --name sirius-web-postgres \
       -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser \
       -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpwd \
       -e POSTGRES_DB=sirius-web-db \
       -d postgres:15
----

This command:

- Creates a database named `sirius-web-db`
- With user `dbuser` and password `dbpwd`
- Maps container port `5432` to host port `5433`

You may customize these values as needed.

TIP: Add `--rm` to the command if you want the container to be automatically removed when stopped (useful for test environments).

=== Step 2: Run the Sirius Web Application

Once the database is running, start the Sirius Web application using:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar sirius-web-sample-application.jar \
     --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5433/sirius-web-db \
     --spring.datasource.username=dbuser \
     --spring.datasource.password=dbpwd
----

[NOTE]
====
*Sirius Web fat JAR*:
The `sirius-web-sample-application.jar` is a self-contained executable archive (also known as a "fat JAR") that includes all dependencies required to run the application.

You can download the latest stable release (e.g., `sirius-web-YYYY.MM.0`) from the official https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/packages/2069582/versions[GitHub Packages page]
====

This command starts the application and connects it to the PostgreSQL database you previously set up.

Make sure the database is running on the specified port, and that the credentials (`dbuser`, `dbpwd`) match those passed to Docker.

Once your Docker up, go directly to the <<openwebbrowser>> section.

[#openwebbrowser]
== Open your web browser

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to experience {product}.

[CAUTION]
====
To end your local testing session, confirm you stop the running PostgreSQL and {product} Docker container and by using the command `docker compose down`.
Note that this erases all the data you have generated during testing.

If you meet any issues during the installation process, see the xref:troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting guide] for detailed solutions.
