= Configure Anti-virus software for use with {product} server

While we can't directly recommend specific antivirus software for use with {product} applications, we want to advise our customers that if you are experiencing slowness with your {product} application, try running it with virus checking disabled.

Due to the high volume of temporary files generated by {product} applications, antivirus software can significantly impact performance by causing excessive disk I/O and resource contention.
In some cases, even disabling antivirus software might not be sufficient to resolve performance issues.
In such situations, you may need to restart the server or completely uninstall the antivirus software.

Here are some specific recommendations for configuring antivirus software for use with {product} server:

* *Exclude {product} Application Folders from Scanning*: Identify the installation directory of your {product} application and exclude it from regular antivirus scans.
This will minimize the impact of antivirus scanning on {product} performance.
* *Schedule Scanning Times*: If possible, schedule antivirus scans during off-peak hours when {product} usage is minimal.
This will reduce the likelihood of performance degradation during active usage periods.
* *Configure Real-time Scanning*: Adjust real-time scanning settings to minimize the impact on {product} performance.
Consider disabling real-time scanning for specific {product} processes or files that are known to cause performance issues.
* *Monitor Resource Utilization*: Continuously monitor resource utilization, especially CPU and disk I/O, to identify any potential bottlenecks caused by antivirus software.
Adjust scanning settings or consider uninstalling the antivirus software if it significantly impacts {product} performance.
* *Consult with Antivirus Vendor*: If you continue to experience performance issues despite optimizing antivirus settings, consider contacting the antivirus vendor for specific guidance on configuring their software for optimal compatibility with {product} applications.

Remember, the goal is to achieve a balance between comprehensive antivirus protection and minimizing its impact on {product} performance.
By carefully configuring antivirus settings and monitoring resource utilization, you can ensure that your {product} server operates smoothly while maintaining a robust security posture.
