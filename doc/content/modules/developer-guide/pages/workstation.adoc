= Workstation requirements

include::ROOT:partial$before-you-start-experimental-developer.adoc[]

Use this checklist to prepare a developer workstation before you start building or extending {product}.
It complements the server-side requirements listed in the installation guide and focuses on the tools you need locally to run the training labs, compile the backend, and build the frontend.

== Operating system

{product} development works on any recent 64-bit desktop OS:

* Windows 10 or later
* macOS 13 Ventura or later
* Linux distributions with good Docker support (Ubuntu LTS, Fedora, Debian, etc.)

== Core tooling

[cols="25,35,40",options="header"]
|Tool
|Version / Notes
|Verification

|Git & Git Bash (Windows)
|Install Git for your platform; on Windows add Git Bash to get a Unix-like shell that matches the training scripts.
|`git --version` and (on Windows) run `ls -la` inside Git Bash to confirm the shell works.

|Java Development Kit
|Temurin JDK 17 (same runtime used by the server). Install it even if you rely on IDE-managed JDKs so Maven and the CLI can run.
|`java -version`

|Maven
|Apache Maven 3.9.x.
|`mvn -version`

|Node.js & npm
|Node.js 18.7.0 (npm 8.15.0). Use NVM for easy upgrades:
* Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
* Linux/macOS: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
|`node -v` and `npm -v`

|Docker Desktop / Engine
|Latest stable release, configured to allocate at least 4 GB RAM. Required for local PostgreSQL and the sample deployments used in trainings.
|`docker --version`

|GitHub account & PAT
|Create a GitHub account and generate a personal access token with the `read:packages` scope to pull private artifacts when required.
|Log in with `gh auth login` or use the token when cloning; store it securely (password manager or OS keychain).

== Recommended IDEs and extensions

* **Backend**: IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code with Java tooling.
* **Frontend**: VS Code or WebStorm with TypeScript support.
* **Docker**: Docker Desktop (UI) or Lens for inspecting containers.
* **GraphQL clients**: Altair, GraphiQL, or IDE plugins to test queries.

Any IDE is acceptable as long as it respects the Maven/Node toolchains above.

== Network and security

* Ensure you can reach GitHub over HTTPS (corporate proxies may require extra configuration).
* Allow Docker to download images from `docker.io`.
* Some corporate antivirus tools aggressively scan Docker volumes or Node modules; whitelist your workspace if you notice build slowdowns.

== Quick validation script

Create a scratch directory and run:

```bash
git --version
java -version
mvn -version
node -v
npm -v
docker --version
```

If every command reports the expected version, your workstation is ready to develop.
