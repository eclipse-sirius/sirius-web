= REST APIs

include::ROOT:partial$before-you-start-experimental-developer.adoc[]

Use this page to explore the REST endpoints provided by {product}.
They are best suited for automation scenarios, CI/CD pipelines, or integration with external systems.

== Endpoint prefix

All endpoints start with `/api/rest/`.
For example:

* `/api/rest/projects` – list projects.
* `/api/rest/projects/projectId` – manage a specific project.
* `/api/rest/libraries` – publish or retrieve libraries.

[NOTE]
====
Authentication uses the same mechanism as the web UI (Bearer token or the configured security model).
====

== OpenAPI and Swagger UI

{product} ships with generated OpenAPI documentation.
Open `http://<host>:<port>/swagger-ui/index.html` in your deployment to browse all endpoints interactively.
You can also export the specification from `/_/attachments/sirius-web-openapi.json`.

[TIP]
====
The Swagger UI embedded in the documentation disables “Try it out” by default.
Use your local instance if you want to test requests directly in a browser.

== Supported endpoints

xref:developer-guide:api-details.adoc[API details] contains the complete list.
Highlights include:

* **Projects**: create, list, delete projects; import/export models.
* **Sessions**: manage representations and interactions for a project.
* **Libraries**: publish, list, and consume reusable libraries.
* **Configuration**: retrieve metadata such as available representation descriptions.

== Usage tips

* Keep commit and branch handling simple: {product} uses a single branch per project today.
* When uploading files, set the correct `Content-Type` (typically `application/json` for models).
* Combine the REST API with automation scripts (shell, Python, CI runners) to bootstrap workspaces.
* For high-frequency or UI-like interactions, consider the GraphQL API instead.
