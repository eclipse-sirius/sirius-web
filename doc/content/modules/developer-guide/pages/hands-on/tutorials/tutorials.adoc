= Package and deploy a studio

Goal: build and launch the sample studio application.

== Steps:

* Use Maven to assemble the backend and frontend modules.
* Launch the application locally (see xref:installation-guide:how-tos/install/local_test.adoc[]).
* Optionally package add-ons (xref:developer-guide:add-ons.adoc[]) to distribute features independently.

TIP: capture build steps in scripts so teammates can rerun them effortlessly.

Expand this track by integrating continuous integration checks, authoring runtime add-ons, or automating deployments once the basics are in place.

TIP: Looking for studio-maker tutorials? Jump to xref:user-manual:hands-on/hands-on.adoc[] where the domain, view, and studio walkthroughs live.
