= Debug performance issues

{product} exposes several hooks to trace slow operations on the backend.

== Backend logging

Enable the dedicated performance log category to see the timings recorded by the runtime (including AQL expressions taking more than 200 ms):

```
logging.level.sirius.web.performance=DEBUG
```

== GraphQL tracing

To break down the time spent in each data fetcher, enable GraphQL tracing:

```
sirius.web.graphql.tracing=true
```

The tracing output helps identify bottlenecks and complements the timing information recorded in the standard logs.
