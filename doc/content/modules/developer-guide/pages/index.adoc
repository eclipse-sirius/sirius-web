This developer guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up your developer environment, contribute to the codebase, and enhance the capability of {product}.

== Retrieving the Source Code

{product} is licensed under the xref:product-legal:index.adoc[(EPL v2)] Open Source license
The source code is openly accessible on GitHub:{source-code-url}

To get the source code, clone the repository using either SSH:

[source, bash, subs="attributes+"]
----
git clone git@github.com:{github-project}.git
----

or HTTPS:

[source, bash, subs="attributes+"]
----
git clone {source-code-url}.git

. Retrieve the source code or fork it if you want to make contribution
. Import _backend_ plugins from {product} repository in your workspace
. Update _settings.xml_ file from your _.m2_ folder to give access to other repositories during the build
  In order to see dependence with access to add in _settings.xml_, have a look on _backend\application\syson-application\pom.xml_
  You need to create https://github.com/settings/tokens[access tokens] on Github to complete _settings.xml_.

. Update Maven project by launching "ALT+F5" shortcut on all modules of your workspace


== Generate a new OpenAPI documentation of REST API

. Build and run the syson server locally (using docker compose as example) on `http://localhost:8080`.
. Download the documentation at the url: `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs/rest-apis`.
. The swagger-ui user interface is `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.
