= APIs overview

{product} exposes two complimentary APIs:

* REST endpoints focused on automation and integration with existing tooling.
* GraphQL endpoints used by the web client and available to custom front ends.

Choose the approach that best fits your deployment, then dive into the detailed pages linked below.

== REST APIs

The REST surface area focuses on automation scenarios: importing/exporting projects, publishing libraries, managing sessions, etc.
Key characteristics:

* Every endpoint is rooted at `/api/rest/…`.
* Authentication and authorization rely on the same mechanisms as the web UI (typically Bearer tokens).
* OpenAPI documentation is generated automatically; you can inspect it via `/swagger-ui/index.html` in your deployment.

See xref:developer-guide:api-rest.adoc[] for the full list of endpoints, request/response payloads, and usage tips.

== GraphQL APIs

GraphQL powers the live web client and is ideal when building custom front ends or extensions that need fine-grained access.
Highlights:

* A single `/graphql` endpoint serves both queries and mutations.
* The schema mirrors the concepts exposed in the UI (projects, representations, view descriptions).
* You can introspect the schema using GraphiQL or any GraphQL IDE.

See xref:developer-guide:api-graphql.adoc[] for details about authentication, schema exploration, and mutation examples.
