= GraphQL APIs

include::ROOT:partial$before-you-start-experimental-developer.adoc[]

GraphQL powers the {product} web client. You can leverage the same endpoint to build custom front ends or automation scripts that need fine-grained access to projects, representations, and view descriptions.

== Endpoint and schema

* The GraphQL endpoint is available at `/graphql`.
* The schema follows the types used in the UI (projects, representations, view descriptions, operations, etc.).
* You can introspect the schema using tools such as GraphiQL, Altair, or any GraphQL IDE:
+
```graphql
{
  __schema {
    types {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

== Authentication

The GraphQL endpoint shares the same authentication layer as the REST API and the web UI.
Send the Bearer token (or the configured security credential) in the `Authorization` header.

== Queries and mutations

* **Queries** fetch data (projects, representations, metadata) and are ideal for building read-only dashboards.
* **Mutations** trigger actions (create representation, execute tool, update view configuration) and mirror what the UI does.
* The GraphQL payloads match the concepts defined in the low-code editor, making it straightforward to reuse your domain knowledge.

Example query to list projects:

```graphql
query Projects {
  viewer {
    projects {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Example mutation to execute a tool:

```graphql
mutation RunTool($input: RunToolInput!) {
  runTool(input: $input) {
    result {
      __typename
    }
  }
}
```

== Tooling tips

* Use GraphiQL to auto-complete schema fields when crafting queries.
* Log requests from the web UI (developer tools / network tab) to see which queries the client uses for a given action.
* When exposing the GraphQL API to external consumers, consider applying rate limiting or query complexity guards.

== When to choose GraphQL

* You need a single endpoint for rich clients (React, Angular, etc.).
* You want to request exactly the fields you need without multiple roundtrips.
* You are building advanced features (custom dashboards, automation UIs) that mirror the {product} client behavior.
