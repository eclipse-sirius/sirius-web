= How to debug performance related issues

== Backend

In order to activate the log dedicated to performance measurement, you should use the configuration property `logging.level.sirius.web.performance=DEBUG`.
Once activated it will also log all AQL expressions taking more than 200ms to execute.

On top of that, it is recommended to debug performance issues to activate the GraphQL tracing support to find the time taken by each datafetcher.
It can be done using the configuration property `sirius.web.graphql.tracing=true`.
