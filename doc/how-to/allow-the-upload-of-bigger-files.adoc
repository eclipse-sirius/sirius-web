= How to allow the upload of bigger files

By default, files upload to Sirius Web are limited to `1048576 bytes` since this is the default configuration of Spring Boot and Tomcat.
You can change this by using the following Spring configuration properties:

- `spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=10MB`
- `spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=10MB`

As a result, you will now be able to support larger files.
You do not have to modify the Sirius Web jar to change this value, you can simply update your environment variables and restart the server.
