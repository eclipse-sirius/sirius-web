= (S) Image overlay

== Problem

To make an element easier to read, a specifier may want to adapt the rendering of its icon by applying a layer according to certain semantic data.
Currently, despite the fact it is possible to provide several images to the same element, only the first will be rendering in the application.

== Key Result

Display on the UI, all images provided for a semantic element.

== Solution

Instead of only retrieving the first image, overlay all layers.

=== Scenario

* For a given element, a list of images is provided.
* On the UI, all the images are overlaid to display the element.

=== Breadboarding

* If the `domain::Entity` is represented by this single image :

image::images/image_overlay_01.svg[entity image]

* We add an algorithm to provide another image if the entity is abstract :

image::images/image_overlay_02.svg[abstract image]

* On the UI, the new representation for the abstract entity are the superposition of these two layers :

image::images/image_overlay_03.png[composed image]

== Rabbit holes

* The declaration of all the images can only be done programmatically.
