= (S) Improve the customization of the navigation bar

== Problem

Currently the Sirius Web navigation bar icon button only supports customizing its image (used as a round button in the top left corner of the application).
And the image is expected to be round.

Downstream applications need a more flexible way of customizing that part of the navigation bar.

== Key Result

=== Acceptance Criteria

- Downstream applications must be able to fully customize the top left corner of the navigation bar.
- The default behavior remains as-is.


== Solution

- The extension point will be updated
