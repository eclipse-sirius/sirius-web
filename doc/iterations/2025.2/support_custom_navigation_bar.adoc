= (S) Support custom navigation bar

== Problem

Currently the Sirius Web navigation bar home button only supports customizing its image (used as a round button in the top left corner of the application).
And the image is expected to be round.

Downstream applications need a more flexible way of customizing that part of the navigation bar.

== Key Result

=== Acceptance Criteria

* Downstream applications must be able to fully customize the top left corner of the navigation bar.
* The default behavior remains as-is.

== Solution

* Extension point `navigationBarIconExtensionPoint` is removed.
* A new extension point allows extenders to provide their own component in place of the current one in the navigation bar.
