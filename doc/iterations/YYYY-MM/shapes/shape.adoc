= (appetite) Shape

== Problem

Short description of the problem.

== Key Result

How we will determine whether the problem has being solved.
Qualitative and quantitative measures.

== Solution

Describe the solution.
The core elements we came up with, presented in a form thatâ€™s easy for people to immediately understand.

Solution must define:

=== Scenario

The user scenario covered by the feature. It should define:

* User
* Scenario name
* What we want to show
* Scenario steps
* Features

=== Breadboarding

UI description made by hand

=== Cutting backs

Sort the things todo, define the nice-to-have. What could be removed if finally the feature does not fit the appetite.

== Rabbit holes

Details about the solution worth calling out to avoid problems.
Try to identify the most risky areas which can trip up our assumptions.
Look critically at what we came up with. Did we miss anything?
Are we making technical assumptions that aren't fair?

== No-gos

List the things which are explicitly out of scope, where we should not spent time.
