= (S) Add initial support for in-project search

== Problem

In large projects with many semantic elements, it can be difficult to find specific elements.
The Omnibox has some support for searching element by name, but it is limited.

The only other alternative currently available is to hunt for the element(s) of interest inside the _Explorer_ view, which quickly becomes impossible if the project is large and the user does not know already where in the model hierarchy the elements are located.

== Key Result

* It should be possible to search for elements by name, and to see the results in a dedicated view.
* Once a search is performed, it should be possible to see the results, and to select the matched elements to reveal them in the other views.

In this shape we will focus on a first, basic version of the feature, which should already improve the user experience.
It will be extended in future shapes to add more advanced features.

== Solution

We will add a new lef-side panel named "Search".

Its UI will be organised in two main parts:

1. At the top:
  - a text field to input the search terms;
  - some toggles to control the search options (match case, match whole word, use regular expressions, search in attributes);
  - a button to actually launch the search.
2. Below, a part to display the results once they are received.
In this initial version the search results will be displayed as a flat list of matching elements (similar to what is done in the _Query_ view).

A search will only be launched on explicit request by the user (with the "Search" button).
The result of a search will not be a live representation but a fixed snapshot corresponding to the result at the time of the search.

The search implemented in the backend will be a simple in-memory search through all the elements of the editing context, looking for matches in the default label of the elements, and optionally in (the string representation of) their attributes.

It will return a flat list of matching elements, without any pagination or advanced sorting/ranking, nor with details about where the match was found (e.g. in the label or in a specific attribute).
These advanced features will be considered in future shapes.

=== Scenario

1. The user opens the "Search" panel.
It is initially empty, with only the search input field and options visible.
2. The user inputs a search term in the text field, and configures the search options as desired.
3. The user clicks the "Search" button.
4. The search query is launched.
The search panel shows a loading indicator while waiting for the results.
5. Once the results are received, they are displayed in the lower part of the panel as a flat list of matching elements.
Each element is displayed with its default label and an icon representing its type.
6. The user can scroll through the list of results and click on any element to select it and reveal it in the other views (e.g. _Explorer_, _Diagram_).

=== Cutting backs

None for this initial version, as it is designed on purpose to be a basic but usable version to build upon in future shapes.
