= Add the ability to give users an obvious visual cue as to whether the diagram is editable or read-only

== Problem

There is a lack of visual cues as to whether a diagram is in read-only or is editable.
The grid background conditionned to the "snap to grid" state would be a good visual cue but it is hardcoded to be disabled by default.

== Key Result

Give the ability to applications to choose the default "snap to grid" state and how it can be changed depending on whether the diagram is read-only or editable.

== Solution

== Cutting Backs

== Rabbit Holes

== No-Gos
