= (S) Control the views available in a workbench

== Problem

The workbench views available in the workbench are hardcoded in the entire application, they are always the same in all workbenches.


== Key Result

We want to be able to provide a specific set of workbench views per workbench.


=== Acceptance Criteria

One should be able to contribute a workbench view for a specific project.
Integration tests will be provided


== Solution

A new query will be available to fetch the configuration of the workbench views when the project is opened.
The API of the `Workbench` component will also be updated to leverage a workbench configuration.


=== Breadboarding


=== Cutting backs

- This will not be dynamically refreshed to automatically open views
- This will not manipulate the internal state of the workbench views


== Rabbit holes


== No-go
