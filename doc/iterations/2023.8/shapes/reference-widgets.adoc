= (L) Add new custom widget to edit single and multi-valued references

== Problem

On the desktop side, Sirius (via EEF) provides rich widgets in its properties view to edit object references.
They support both mono-valued and multi-valued references, either contained or not, with all the relevant operations directly available in the widget: value selection, re-ordering, creation of new objects to add to the reference, etc.

On the web side, we only support a limited subset of this with the `Select` and `Multiselect` widgets, but by default they are only used for non-containment reference, and they do not support the richer behaviors of the EEF counterparts.
The `Multiselect` also does not scale well when the list of possible candidates gets large.
It is not possible to build the richer behaviors by combining these base widgets with others like `List` and `Button` as in a Sirius Web Form widgets are independant and do not have a "local" selection that other widgets could know about (for example for an "Up" button to know which element is selected in a sibling `List` widget to know on which element to operate).

== Key Result

Sirius Components will provide a new _custom_ widget to edit references which can be used either directly from the core APIs or via the View DSL.
It will provide the same level of configuration and features as its EEF counterpart: the specifier simply indicates which setting (owner and reference) to edit, and the widget adapts its look and features to the characteristics of the reference.

The widget will be implemented as a _custom widget_ using the extension mechanism introduced in Sirius Component v2023.6.0 via https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1914[#1914].
It will be provided in new projects (Maven modules and NPM packages) in Sirius Components.

The default rules used by Sirius Components to builds its _Details_ view will be updated to use the new widget.

Other applications will be able to use it as-is by adding the appropriate dependency.
If the hard-coded look and behavior of the widget does not match their need, applications will need to use it as a base to fork and create their own, more specific version.
Later on, the widget provided by Sirius Components may evolve to become more configurable to avoid this, but this is out of scope of the initial version.

== Solution

We will provide a single new custom widget in Sirius Components to view and edit (EMF) references.

The new widgets will provide the same level of configuration as its EEF equivalent:

* _Label expression_ and _Is Enabled Expression_ (the implementation of the _Is Enabled Expression_ is actually out of scope of this shape, as it will be implemented for all widgets in a separate shape).
* _Reference Owner Expression_ (optional): if specified, the reference edited will be search on the value of the expression, instead of the current element (`self`)
* _Reference Name Expression_: the name of the expression to edit.
* _Initial Operation_: if specified, the corresponding behavior will be executed when the user clicks on the/an element referenced.
In the case of the mono-valued reference widget, if the initial operation is defined the widget will be displayed as a hyper-link (instead of a plain label) and the operation executed on a single-click.
In the case of the multi-valued reference widget, if the initial operation is defined it will be invoked on a _double-click_ on an element in the list (single-click is needed to select the elements on which the "Delete" and "Up/Down" buttons operate.).

The widget will have a different UI and behavior depending on the nature of the reference to edit.

If the reference is **single-valued** it will show:

1. The icon & label of the referenced element (or nothing if the reference is unset).
The computation of the icon & label's text will be hard-coded to use the EMF Edit's item provider.
If the widget has an `onClickExpression`, the label is not a plain text but a hyper-link which executes the expression when clicked.
2. A "+" button if (and only if) the reference is a containment reference.
This opens an _object creation dialog_ to i) create a new object instance, ii) set the reference's value to it.
See below for details on this dialog/modal.
3. A "..." (_browse_) button which opens a dialog to select the value to reference.
The dialog provides a (sorted) list of candidates and the ability to search/filter (by label).
The contents of the dialog is hard-coded to show all the compatible instances in the editing context (project), and to use the EMF Edit's item provider for the elements' label and icon.
4. A "âˆ…" button to unset the reference.
It's behavior will be hard-coded to call `target.eUnset(reference)`.

In the case of a **multi-valued reference**, the UI will display:

1. A list of the currently referenced elements, in the order they are stored and with the icon & label from their EMF Edit's item provider.
The list will have a "reasonable" maximum height (to be defined precisely) and will provide vertical scroll bars if their are more elements.
The list will support selecting/unselecting multiple elements to control
2. A "..." (_browse_) button to open a dialog/modal equivalent to EMF's `FeatureSelectionDialog` so that the user can edit the contents of the reference.
3. A "+" (create) button if (and only if) the reference is a containment reference.
This opens an _object creation dialog_ to i) create a new object instance, ii) add it to the reference (at the end).
See below for details on this dialog/modal.
4. A "X" (remove) button to remove the element(s) currently selected in the list from the reference.
The behavior will be hard-coded to use `EcoreUtil.remove()`.
5. Two "Up" and "Down" buttons to change the position of the element(s) currently selected in the list inside the reference.
The behavior will be hard-coded to use `EList.move()`.

They will be provided as optional custom widgets, that applications can decide to use or not.
Sirius Web will use them in the default Details view in `MonoValuedNonContainmentReferenceIfDescriptionProvider` and `MultiValuedNonContainmentReferenceIfDescriptionProvider`.

=== Object creation dialog

The Object Creation dialog/modal will display:

* A Tree with the same content as the Explorer (but only showing the semantic elements).
The user will need to select the container element in which the new object should be created.
This part is only displayed when editing a non-containment reference.
For contained references, the container is implied to be the owner of the reference being edited.
* A Select/Combo which, when a container element is selected, proposes all the references of the element's type which are type-compatible with the reference being edited.
If the object creation dialog is used on a containment reference, only the containement references will be proposed (and vice versa for non-containement references).
* A Select/Combo which, when a container element *and* a type-compatible reference are selected, proposes all the concrete object types that can be created.
* A "Create" button, which is only enabled when a container element, a type-compatible reference and a concrete type are selected.

Upon validation, the modal will create an instance of the chosen type, and set/add it to the chosen reference.
If this is a multi-valued reference, the new object is added at the end.
The newly created object will be a "default instance" of the selected type; there is no mechanism provided to initialize it further.

=== Support for reference editing through DnD

It should be possible to set (resp. add to) the value of a reference by dragging and dropping a (compatible) semantic element from the _Explorer_ view onto the reference widget.

=== Styling

TBD.

=== Breadboarding

TBD.

The UI described above corresponds to the one in EEF desktop.
We may decide to make different choices if they are more adapted to the Sirius Web context as long as all the same features are available.
For example, we may want to replace the "X" button outside of the list with a "TrashCan" icon on each list item (like we do for the _Representations_ representation), or (if technically possible), replace the "Up/Down" buttons with direct DnD of list items to re-order them.

=== Cutting backs

Note: the whole "Object creation dialog" seems redundant if we support DnD from the explorer.
It will never be as powerful as the actual explorer, which already has all the features needed (navigating in the tree, filtering, creating new elements).
In Sirius Desktop, the "Model Explorer" did not support the creation of new elements, so it made sense to have a dialog for that.
Here it seems like spending a significant amount of time for creating a worse version of the explorer.

* Using the new reference widget in Sirius Components's default properties rules (replacement of `MonoValuedNonContainmentReferenceIfDescriptionProvider` and `MultiValuedNonContainmentReferenceIfDescriptionProvider`).
* Support for drag'n'drop for direct re-ordering of elements in a multi-valued reference.
* Making the object creation dialog "smart" enough to allow only for the creation of elements 

== Rabbit holes

TBD.

== No-gos

* Customizability (for example "target" elements of the reference computed from an expression instead of looking at the direct value of the EMF Setting).
* Virtualizing the content of the various "list" Material widgets (in the multi-valued widget, in the dialogs) to handle very large lists.
