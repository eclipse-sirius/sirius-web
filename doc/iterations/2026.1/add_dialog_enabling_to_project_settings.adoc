= Add confirmation dialog enabling/disabling to project settings

== Problem

Confirmation dialogs can be disabled by and for a client, but they cannot be re-enabled afterward.
Moreover, disabling them currently applies to the entire application and is not scoped to a specific project.

== Key Result

Sirius Web should provide a way to re-enable dialogs.

This mechanism should be scoped to a project.

=== Acceptance Criteria

Existing Cypress tests should leverage the new functionality, and new tests must be created to verify the scoping of delete-modal disabling.

== Solution

We propose adding a new boolean setting in the project settings page.
This setting is displayed inside a new contributed settings tab named "General."

=== Cutting backs

== Rabbit holes

== No-gos
