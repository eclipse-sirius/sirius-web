= Add support for search history

== Problem

Users would like to have quick access to their previous searches.

== Key Result

- Once a user select the "search" command in the omnibox, the previous searches should be displayed.
- It should be easy for a user to re-run a previous search by clicking on the suggested items.
- Only the last 10 searches will be kept.


=== Acceptance Criteria
