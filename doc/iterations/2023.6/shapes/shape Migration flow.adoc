== Problem

In order to include a test which covers the all odesign to view migration path, we will migrate the existing flow model.

This view model should be generated using the soon to be introduced Java APIs to create view models. https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1919

== Key Result

The flow odesign model should be converted to a view model. All concepts used in the flow model should have a respective view concept.

== Solution

Use the soon to be introduced Java APIs to create view models. https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1919

=== Scenario

Giving a flow model defined in a odesign file, we should be able to generate a view model which  match all the concepts existing in the odesign flow model

=== Breadboarding

No UI involved

=== Cutting backs

== Rabbit holes

== No-gos
