= (M) Provide a view-based version of Flow

== Problem

In order to include a test which covers the odesign to view transformation, we will migrate the existing flow model.

== Key Result

The new view-based version of flow is fully equivalent to the previous odesign based version, all integrations tests of the odesign version of flow are working on the new version

== Solution

We will use the same maven package flow's dependencies.
We will offer an interface that if implemented will convert the odesign from their path to Views.

=== Scenario

The end user will open Sirius Web and not see any single change at all.

Everything will work as before including our Cypress integration tests.

=== Breadboarding

no ui changes

=== Cutting backs

Some concepts might not be available in the first implementation of the odesign converter.
They will be added back progressively

== Rabbit holes

== No-gos
