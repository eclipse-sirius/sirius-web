= (M) Add support for the features of the compatibility layer not supported in the view DSL

== Problem

Some odesign concepts are not implemented in View (like selection dialogs or icons support). 

== Key Result

Each new feature works and can be used by the end user, the new flow version is updated to use those features, integration tests of those features are available

== Solution

For each concepts we should provide an adrs that will explain the solution if more details.

We should also provide some mock ui in these adrs.

=== Scenario

An user will be able to use the newly implemented concept that was available in odesign models in updated views.

=== Breadboarding

Futurs ui changes will be discussed in their respective adrs.

=== Cutting backs

Some concepts may be challenging to implement. We will discuss it further in specific adrs.

== Rabbit holes
