= ADR-041 - Add the ability to contribute additional services to the EMFQueryService

== Context

We have only one hardcoded service in the `EMFQueryService` and we want to be able to contribute new ones.

== Decision

We will add a new interface like this one:

```
public interface IQueryJavaServiceProvider {
  List<Class<?>> getClasses(IEditingContext editingContext);
}
```

We will retrieve all those providers in the `EMFQueryService` and use them to register the additional Java services in the `AQLInterpreter` used.

We will keep the existing `EditingContextServices` class hardcoded.

== Status

Accepted
