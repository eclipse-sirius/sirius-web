= ADR-067 - Add support for injecting platform services/beans into Java service classes used by studios

== Context

Studio definitions are configured using the View DSL, which (by design) has a limited scope.
For more complex operations it is possible (and recommanded) to drop down to Java using service classes/methods invoked from AQL expressions.
These service classes are registered with an `IJavaServiceProvider`.

The way these Java service classes are currently instantiated (a no-arg public constructor invoked by AQL) means they can not have access to the APIs the platform defines (e.g. `IObjectService`) and thus their power is very limited.
In particular they can not navigate into the graphical model or make modifications to it (notably, add `ViewCreationRequest` or `ViewDeletionRequest`).

== Decision

We will change `AQLInterpreter` to accept _instances_ in addition to classes as sources for AQL `IServices`.
AQL already supports this directly.

A new constructor will be added to `AQLInterpreter` which accepts already built instances in addition to classes (that AQL will continue to instantiate as before):

[source,java]
----
    public AQLInterpreter(List<Class<?>> classes, List<Object> instances, List<EPackage> ePackages) {
        this.queryEnvironment = Query.newEnvironmentWithDefaultServices(new SimpleCrossReferenceProvider());
        this.queryEnvironment.registerEPackage(EcorePackage.eINSTANCE);
        this.queryEnvironment.registerCustomClassMapping(EcorePackage.eINSTANCE.getEStringToStringMapEntry(), EStringToStringMapEntryImpl.class);

        for (Class<?> aClass : classes) {
            Set<IService> services = ServiceUtils.getServices(this.queryEnvironment, aClass);
            ServiceUtils.registerServices(this.queryEnvironment, services);
        }
        // <ADDED>
        for (Object instance : instances) {
            Set<IService> services = ServiceUtils.getServices(this.queryEnvironment, instance);
            ServiceUtils.registerServices(this.queryEnvironment, services);
        }
        // </ADDED>

        ePackages.stream().filter(this::isValidEPackage).forEach(this.queryEnvironment::registerEPackage);

        this.initExpressionsCache();
    }
----

The previous constructor with two arguments will be kept for compatibility, and simlpy delegate to the new, more capable one:

[source,java]
----
    public AQLInterpreter(List<Class<?>> classes, List<EPackage> ePackages) {
        this(classes, List.of(), ePackages);
    }
----

Instead of passing directly the classes returned by `IJavaServiceProvider` to AQL, the AQL interpreter created for View-based modelers (in `ViewConverter`) will use Spring's `ApplicationContext` to instanciate beans from these classes, injecting any dependencies they declare in their construtor to the bean instances:

[source,java]
----
    private AQLInterpreter createInterpreter(View view, List<EPackage> visibleEPackages) {
        AutowireCapableBeanFactory beanFactory = this.applicationContext.getAutowireCapableBeanFactory();
        // @formatter:off
        List<Object> serviceInstances = this.javaServiceProviders.stream()
                                            .flatMap(provider -> provider.getServiceClasses(view).stream())
                                            .map(serviceClass -> {
                                                try {
                                                    return beanFactory.createBean(serviceClass);
                                                } catch (BeansException beansException) {
                                                    LOGGER.error("Error while trying to instantiate Java service class " + serviceClass.getName(), beansException); //$NON-NLS-1$
                                                    return null;
                                                }
                                            })
                                            .filter(Objects::nonNull)
                                            .collect(Collectors.toList());
        // @formatter:on
        return new AQLInterpreter(List.of(), serviceInstances, visibleEPackages);
    }
----

Service classes that need platform services for their implementation will need to ask for them in their constructor.
For example:

[source,java]
----
public class SampleDiagramServices {
    private final IObjectService objectService;

    public SampleDiagramServices(IObjectService objectService) {
        this.objectService = Objects.requireNonNull(objectService);
    }

    public EObject onDrop(EObject self, IDiagramContext diagramContext) {
        var id = this.objectService.getId(self);
        var label = this.objectService.getLabel(self);
        System.out.println(String.format("Drop tool called on { id: %s, label: %s }", id, label)); //$NON-NLS-1$
        return self;
    }
}
----

The beans injected this way will be global `@Service` instances which provide APIs but are stateless.
In particular they do not know about the current diagram/representation on which a tool is invoked.

For this graphical state, we will continue to rely on variables exposed the the tools and expressions.
In the example above, the `onDrop` method takes the `IDiagramContext` as argument, which is available in the existing `diagramContext` variable.
The AQL expression used to invoke that service will need to pass it explicitly: `aql:self.onDrop(diagramContext)`.

== Status

Accepted.

== Consequences

`ViewConverter` will now need a Spring `ApplicationContext` to be instanciated.
This would prevent writing plain unit tests like `DynamicDiagramsTests` which currently do not need a Spring context.
To keep these tests simple, `ViewConverter` will accept a `null` `ApplicationContext`, in which case it will fall back to the previous behavior and not attempt to instanciate the classes returned by the `IJavaServiceProviders`.

The current platform services that can be injected like this (e.g. `IObjectService`, `IRepresentationDescriptionSearchService`, etc.) have been designed with the needs of the platform and applications in mind.
They may be relatively difficult to discover/use for studio makers.
We may choose to provide easier to use "fa√ßade" services later on when the concrete needs of studio makers are better known.

Similarly, we may need to modify/augment the variables exposed to the evaluation contexts if the current ones are not enough to use the platform services.

With this mechanism, *any* bean defined in the global application context can be injected into a service class.
It is up to the studio maker to use them responsibly, and in particular to avoid making modifications outside of the current editing context.
