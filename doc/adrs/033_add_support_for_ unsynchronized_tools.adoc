= ADR-033 - Add support for unsynchronized tools

== Context

We want to provide the graphical selection to the tools of the diagram.
Indeed, an unsynchronized tool will use the graphical selection to implement its behavior.

== Decision

We will only support node selection and single selection for the moment.

=== Execution

The `InvokeNodeToolOnDiagramEventHandler`, `DeleteFromDiagramEventHandler` and a future `DropOnDiagramEventHandler` will add the current node selection to the variable manager.
A new variable named `selectedNode` will be available in the variable manager for this purpose.
If the variable is not available, the tool should consider that the selection is the diagram itself.

== Status

Accepted

== Consequences

We will have to update our Sirius RCP compatibility layer after that to leverage the information from the odesign.
