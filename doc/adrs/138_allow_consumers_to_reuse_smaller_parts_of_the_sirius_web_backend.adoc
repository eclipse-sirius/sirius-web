= ADR-138 Allow consumers to reuse smaller parts of the Sirius Web backend

== Context

Sirius Web can now be reused more easily but some of our consumers want to reuse only a subset of Sirius Web.
Thanks to our domain driven design based approach, the content of Sirius Web is now separated in various bounded context.

== Decision

We will enforce an even stronger separation betwen our various bounded context by separating the bounded contexts in various projects.
For that we will introduce the following new projects:

=== Project

* `sirius-web-project-domain`
** no dependency other bounded contexts
* `sirius-web-project-application`
** depends on `sirius-web-project-domain`

=== Semantic Data

* `sirius-web-semanticdata-domain`
** depends on `sirius-web-project-domain`
* `sirius-web-semanticdata-application`
** depends on `sirius-web-semanticdata-domain`

=== Representation Data

* `sirius-web-representationdata-domain`
** depends on `sirius-web-project-domain`
* sirius-web-representationdata-application
** depends on `sirius-web-representationdata-domain`


== Status

Work in progress

== Consequences

The existing Sirius Web projects will be transformed and a stronger separation will appear between our various bounded contexts.
It will then be possible to use the project bounded context of Sirius Web without dependencies to the semantic data or representation data bounded contexts.

We will have to provide a similar separation on the frontend side too
