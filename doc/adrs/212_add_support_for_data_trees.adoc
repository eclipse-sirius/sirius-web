= ADR-212 - Add support for data trees

== Context

In various places, we want (or will want) to display static trees computed by the backend.
This is the case in the impact analysis, and could be the case in the search view.
We want to have an off-the-shelf solution we can reuse to construct and display these trees.

== Decision

We will create a new package `sirius-components-datatree` to hold the backend and frontend code of this new feature.

This package should be independent of the context where the data trees will be displayed (e.g. no reference to impact analysis information).

We will create a GraphQL schema `datatree.graphqls` with the relevant records in the backend:

[source, graphqls]
----
type DataTree {
  id: ID!
  label: String!
  iconURL: [String!]!
  nodes: [DataTreeNode!]!
}

type DataTreeNode {
  id: ID!
  parentId: ID
  label: StyledString!
  iconURL: [String!]!
  endIconsURL: [[String!]!]!
}
----

We will create a `DataTree` component in the frontend that can display such data.
The `DataTree` component will be a simplified version of the `TreePropertySection` already defined in the `forms` package.

== Consequences

It will be possible to integrate data trees where needed in Sirius Web.
For example, the impact analysis APIs could integrate it to display the impacts of a change as a tree.

In the frontend, `sirius-components-datatree` will have a dependency to `sirius-components-core` (to display `StyledLabel`).
This implies that code in `sirius-components-core` won't be able to depend on `sirius-components-datatree` to avoid circular dependencies.
It may be necessary to move some code where we want to use data trees to break this circular dependency (e.g. the impact analysis code should be moved to `core/sirius-components-impactanalysis`).

== Status

Proposed.
