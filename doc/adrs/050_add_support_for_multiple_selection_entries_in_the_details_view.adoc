= ADR-050 - Add support for multiple selection entries in the details view

== Context

The API of the selection has changed a couple months ago in order to support multiple selection entries.
We did not have the time to support those multiple selection entries in the details view.
Now we want to see the details of all the selection entries supported by the details view.

== Decision

The default description used for the details view will not support multiple selection entries and the frontend will be adapted to display the various selection entries at once.
For that, the backend will return one page per selection entry supported with the label of each entry used as the label of the page.
We will only display the properties of the semantic elements for now.

On the frontend side, we will now use the MaterialUI tabs in order to display a tab for each page returned by the server.
Those tabs will share a similar appearance as the representation tabs.

== Status
