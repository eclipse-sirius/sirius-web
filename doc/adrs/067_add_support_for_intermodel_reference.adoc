= ADR-067 - Add suport for intermodel references

== Context

The context is an EMF editing context with a ResourceSet containing at least two models and references between the models.
We should be have to load and save properly those models.

Currently, the URI used to add resources in the ResourceSet is the id of the document.
That is an issue because IllegalArgumentException are raised from some EMF code part (such as URI.resolve(URI)).
A valid URI must contain a scheme.
So the URI of the resources added to the resourceSet should be on the form:
`<scheme>:///<id de la resource>`

For the URI, corresponding to document added in the project, loaded as JSONResource, the URI scheme is arbitrary : 
``sirius``
Example: `sirius:///a264d307-97d9-451d-90f5-46d38668b69c`

== Decision

For the URI, corresponding to document added in the project, loaded as JSONResource, the URI scheme is arbitrary : 
``sirius``
Example: `sirius:///a264d307-97d9-451d-90f5-46d38668b69c`

== Status

Accepted.
