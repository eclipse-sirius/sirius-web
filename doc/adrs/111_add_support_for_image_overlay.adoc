= ADR-111 - Add support for image overlay

== Context

Despite the fact that more than one image can be contribute for an EMF label, only the first one is displayed on the UI.
So it's not possible for a specifier to build icons composed of several layers.

== Decision

* Change the `IObjectService` methode `getImagePath` to no longer return a single _string_ but the list of all the image paths.
* Change all the `.graphql` schemas to no longer support single _string_ but an array of _string_.
* Change the image rendering to merge all the image layers into one _div_ where:

```css
imageContainer: {
  position: 'relative',
},

image: {
  position: 'absolute',
  top: 0,
  left: 0,
},
```

On each layer apply the CSS properties _z-index_ to guarantee the render order.

== Status

Accepted

== Consequences

* All API with `iconURL` will be modified to use an array of _string_ from now on.
