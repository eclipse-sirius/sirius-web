= ADR-039 - Provide a variable to detect the environment

== Context

We need to be able to distinguish the environment in which our representation descriptions are executed.
This would help us create odesign which works both in the desktop environment and in a web environment.

== Decision

We will add a new variable named `environment` using the newly created type `Environment` in all the variable managers created to execute operations.

```
package org.eclipse.sirius.web.core.api;

public class Environment {

  public static final String ENVIRONMENT = "environment";

  private final String name;

  public Environment(String name) {
    this.name = Objects.requireNonNull(name);
  }

  public String getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
}
```

It will be provided like other variables: `variableManager.put(Environment.ENVIRONMENT, new Environment("siriusComponents");`

== Status

WIP

== Consequences

Each product should be able one day to configure how the environment is created in order to provide a more precise name.
