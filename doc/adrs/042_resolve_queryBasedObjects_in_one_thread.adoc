= ADR-042 - Resolve queryBasedObjects in one thread

== Context

We want to be able to resolve graphQL queries containing aql expressions.
Currently one thread is created for each sub-request, leading to performances issues. 

== Decision

=== Backend

ObjectQueryBasedBooleanDataFetcher, ObjectQueryBasedIntDataFetcher, ObjectQueryBasedStringDataFetcher, ObjectQueryBasedObjectsDataFetcher and ObjectQueryBasedObjectDataFetcher will be deleted.
They will be replaced by a single QueryResultDataFetcher, which will compute the result for the parent query and with the query of its children.

== Status

WIP
