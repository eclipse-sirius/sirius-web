= [ADR-106] Add the support for the palette with reactflow

== Context

We have chosen to use reactflow to do the layout of diagram.
In the early use, the layout will be done in the frontend.
We need to support features like a palette.
The palette will be displayed on top of the selected node and at the position of the click on the diagram pane.

== Decision

We will rely on the https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/nodes/node-toolbar/[reactflow NodeToolbar] for node and our implementation for the diagram palette.

In the first version, when a node is selected, its palette will be displayed.
Once opened, the diagram palette will be displayed until the selection is changed.
The palette will be closed when the diagram pane is dragged.

== Status

Accepted.

== Consequences

Once opened the palette will almost always be opened.
We may add a way to close the palette manually later.
