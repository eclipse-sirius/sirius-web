= [ADR-136] Add variables in FormDescription entity in the view form dsl.

== Context

Following [ADR-109] Link widgets together in forms, a first implementation allows the specifiers to add variables to the `VariableManager` used by `FormDescription`.

We want to allow specifiers to leverage this new mechanism in the view form dsl.

== Decision

We will add the ability for specifiers to create variables in the form view dsl.

=== FormVariable entity

We will need to add an entity `FormVariable` contained in `FormDescription`.

`FormVariable` will have 2 attributes : 

- name : EString 
- defaultValueExpression: InterpretedExpression

== Status

Work in progress

== Consequences
