= ADR-052 - Stop considering the source and target anchors as routing points anymore

== Context

We have a different approach than Sprotty to handle edge route. That different approach has been needed to compute the position of edge labels. While our layout engines (ELK layout engine and incremental layout engine) save source and target anchors as routing points in the model, Sprotty does not. That difference is one of the causes that makes edges blink when Sprotty renders the diagram, and that something we want to get rid of.

== Decision

We will stop considering the source and target anchors as routing points. The new behavior will come with https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1065[#1065]. This new behavior should come after the implementation of a custom router discussed in xref:051_add_support_of_custom_anchors_on_frontend.adoc[ADR-051]

=== Backend

We will keep the `EdgeRoutingPointsProvider` to handle self-loop edges.
We will move the edge label position algorithm from the `EdgeRoutingPointsProvider` to `EdgeLabelPositionProvider`.
Since we introduced edge anchor positions we will adapt the `ELKLayoutedDiagramProvider` to compute anchor position instead of the source and target routing points.

=== Frontend

Since this should come after we have customized the sprotty edge router to take account of our edge anchors, we will have to adapt that customization.

== Status

Done

== Consequences

- Source and target anchors will be updated according to the ELK layout after the user has used the `Arrange all`.
- This ADR invalidates xref:017_improve_edge_source_and_target_anchors.adoc[ADR 017 Improve edge source and target anchors]
