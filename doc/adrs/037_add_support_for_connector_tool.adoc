= ADR-037 - Add support for connector tool

== Context
A tool section with a lot of edge tools is not productive.
Indeed, we cannot filter effectively without source/target context.

In the following sample, we want to create a valid edge between A and B.
The tools C, D and E can be applied on A.
Without a good knowledge of the diagram description, we cannot presume if B is a valid target for these edge tools.

We select the C edge tool.
If we cannot create C, we must restart the process and try D or E without any guarantee to succeed.

We are lucky, C can be created :

We have all required data on the front-end side to filter valid edge tools on a given source/target context.
We will provide a workflow to enhance the productivity named "magic edge tool".

== Decision

A connector tool re-use all available create edge tools and can be disabled by the specifier.
It allows to select the source and the target before the concrete create edge tool to apply.
It is available when a source element is selected and if at least one create edge tool can be created on this source.

When it is engaged, we use a delegation pattern to detect a valid target.
At least one underlying create edge tool should be valid to apply the connector tool.

If there are more than one remaining create edge tool, we display the filtered list (the selection apply the tool).
Otherwise, the remaining create edge tool is automatically apply.
