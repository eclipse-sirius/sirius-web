= ADR-029 - Introduce some object services

== Context

We need to perform some operations on model objects and retrieve the results.
For example, we may want to retrieve the name of all the objects with a specific type or with an attribute with a specific value, etc.

We already performed an evaluation of this feature in the past in Sirius Web and part of this code is still available there.
See the following classes to have a look at those capabilities:

- ObjectExpressionBasedBooleanDataFetcher
- ObjectExpressionBasedIntDataFetcher
- ObjectExpressionBasedObjectDataFetcher
- ObjectExpressionBasedObjectsDataFetcher
- ObjectExpressionBasedStringDataFetcher

We will now need to move from a proof of concept to a properly maintained feature of the Sirius Components workbench. 

== Decision

We will define additions to the GraphQL Core API in order to add some object-specific services.
Those services will start with the ability to:

- query objects

Additional capabilities will be added soon with the ability to:

- create new objects
- manipulate relationships between objects
- delete objects

=== GraphQL Object Query service

With GraphQL, every field needs to have a proper type, for that reason if we want to perform a query, we must be able to know the expected return type first.
We will support the following return type for our queries:

- String
- Boolean
- Int
- Object
- Object[]

We will support any query language in the GraphQL API but we may provide only support for AQL in the implementation of this API.
We will add the ability to perform queries on the editing context starting with or without a specific object (i.e. self in Sirius expressions).

As such, we will add the following fields to the GraphQL API of the `EditingContext` and `Object` types:

- `queryBasedString`
- `queryBasedBoolean`
- `queryBasedInt`
- `queryBasedObject`
- `queryBasedObjects`

As a result, it will be possible to perform the following GraphQL queries on a editing context:

```
query {
  viewer {
    editingContext(editingContextId: "...") {
      bob: queryBasedObject(query: "aql:editingContext.findObjectMatching('name', 'bob')") {
        fullName: queryBasedString(query: "aql:self.firstName + ' ' + self.familyName")
        friends: queryBasedObjects(query: "aql.self.friends") {
          firstName: queryBasedString(query: "aql:self.firstName")
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

which would return the following JSON content:

```
{
  "viewer": {
    "editingContext" {
      "bob": {
        "fullName": "Bob Anderson",
        "friends": [
          { "firstName": "Alice" },
          { "firstName": "Lea" },
          { "firstName": "Max" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We could even leverage reflective capabilities to build queries such as this one:

```
query {
  viewer {
    editingContext(editingContextId: "...") {
      bob: queryBasedObject(query: "aql:editingContext.findObjectMatching('name', 'bob')") {
        features: queryBasedObjects(query: "aql.self.eClass.eAllStructuralFeatures()", variableName: "feature") {
          name: queryBasedString(query: "aql:feature.name")
          value: queryBasedString(query: "aql:self.eGet(feature).toString()")
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The result of such a query could be:

```
{
  "viewer": {
    "editingContext" {
      "bob": {
        "features": [
          { "name": "firstName", "value": "Bob"},
          { "name": "familyName", "value": "Anderson"},
          { "name": "age", "value": "42"}
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

== Status

WIP

== Consequences

Applications integrating Sirius Components will need to provide the relevant data fetchers in order to query the EditingContext and its objects.
The code performing the query will be provided inside Sirius Components but it will not have any dependency to GraphQL directly.
