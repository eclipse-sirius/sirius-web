= [ADR-167] Support REST APIs

== Context

REST APIs can be useful to execute CRUD requests in Sirius Web.

=== Current behavior

There are currently no REST APIs allowing to query/modify projects/models in Sirius Web.

== Decision

The decision is to support all REST APIs described in the Systems Modeling Application Programming Interface (API) and Services section "8.1 REST/HTTP PSM" coming from https://www.omg.org/spec/SystemsModelingAPI/.

We will consider at least both the ProjectService and ElementNavigationService endpoints.

Additional resources:
- https://www.omg.org/spec/SystemsModelingAPI/20230201/OpenAPI.json
- https://www.omg.org/spec/SystemsModelingAPI/20230201/Schemas.json

Some concepts in this specification are coming from SysMLv2 (i.e. Element and Relationship).
For example, the `GET /projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/elements/` will return the list of all objects contained in the given project.

Depending on the metamodel, objects could be serialized differently in JSON.
So, Sirius Web will let specifiers serialize their objects as they want.

Some default implementation of the Java services associated to the object-related REST APIs will be provided through a new interface `IDefaultObjectRestService`.
Specifiers will also be able to provide their own implementations by implementing `IObjectRestServiceDelegate` as a spring `Service`.

== Status

Work in progress
