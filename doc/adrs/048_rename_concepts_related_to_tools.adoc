= ADR-048 - Rename concepts related to tools

== Context

The concepts related to our tools are very tightly related to the effect that we think they will have most of the time.
As a result, we have concepts such as the `CreateNodeTool` and the `CreateEdgeTool` in the GraphQL API.
We also have the internal concepts of `NodeCreationEvent` and the `EdgeCreationEvent` in the internal diagram API.

This create an issue since, by design, we cannot predict the behavior of any of those tool or event.
It leads to situation where, we don't consider the information provided by events for the layout or for the palette.
For example, we don't have tools available on edges since `CreateNodeTool` can only be applied to nodes or the background of the diagram since we have only thought about using them to create nodes, border nodes and child nodes.

== Decision

We should rename the two following diagram events since they are only used to carry information related to the positions used when the input has been triggered.

- `NodeCreationEvent` should become `SinglePositionEvent`
- `EdgeCreationEvent` should become `DoublePositionEvent`

The following diagram tools should also be renamed:

- `CreateNodeTool` should become `SingleClickOnOneDiagramElementTool`
- `CreateEdgeTool` should become `SingleClickOnTwoDiagramElementsTool`

== Status

WIP

== Consequences

We should open the API to be able to provide tool on edges too.
It's quite odd that we can't offer anything relevant in the contextual palette of the edges.
