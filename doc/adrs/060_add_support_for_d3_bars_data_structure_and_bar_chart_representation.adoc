= ADR-060 - Add support for d3 bars data-structure and bar-chart representation

== Context

We need the ability to define chart widgets in the Form Representation. This ADR is related to the front-end support. 
The back-end supported is treated by another issue (https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1228[#1228]). 

We will support the D3 Bars data structure and the bar-chart representation.

== Decision

This feature does not aim to create a new standalone representation. The D3 bar-chart will be integrated into a Form Property Section. 
A new `ChartWidgetPropertySection` will be created. It will render the appropriate d3 chart according to the representation type.

=== Data Structure ===

The Bar-chart like representations need the following data structure (copied from the d3 example):

```
alphabet = Array(26) [
  0: Object {letter: "A", frequency: 0.08167}
  1: Object {letter: "B", frequency: 0.01492}
  2: Object {letter: "C", frequency: 0.02782}
  3: Object {letter: "D", frequency: 0.04253}
  4: Object {letter: "E", frequency: 0.12702}
  5: Object {letter: "F", frequency: 0.02288}
  6: Object {letter: "G", frequency: 0.02015}
  7: Object {letter: "H", frequency: 0.06094}
  8: Object {letter: "I", frequency: 0.06966}
  9: Object {letter: "J", frequency: 0.00153}
  10: Object {letter: "K", frequency: 0.00772}
  11: Object {letter: "L", frequency: 0.04025}
  12: Object {letter: "M", frequency: 0.02406}
  13: Object {letter: "N", frequency: 0.06749}
  14: Object {letter: "O", frequency: 0.07507}
  15: Object {letter: "P", frequency: 0.01929}
  16: Object {letter: "Q", frequency: 0.00095}
  17: Object {letter: "R", frequency: 0.05987}
  18: Object {letter: "S", frequency: 0.06327}
  19: Object {letter: "T", frequency: 0.09056}
  20: Object {letter: "U", frequency: 0.02758}
  21: Object {letter: "V", frequency: 0.00978}
  22: Object {letter: "W", frequency: 0.0236}
  23: Object {letter: "X", frequency: 0.0015}
  24: Object {letter: "Y", frequency: 0.01974}
  25: Object {letter: "Z", frequency: 0.00074}
  columns: Array(2) ["letter", "frequency"]
]
```

A new `Chart` and `BarChart` types will be created in `Sirius-Component` frontend. 
To match the needed data-structure, the `BarChart` will define a field representing an array of [key, value] objects.
The label field value will be displayed on the bar-chart y axis. 
It will match the GraphQL Schema described in _GraphQL Schema_ section.

```
export interface Chart extends GQLRepresentation {
  metadata: GQLRepresentationMetadata;
}

export interface BarChart extends Chart {
  label: String;
  entries: BarChartEntry[];
}

export interface BarChartEntry {
  key: string;
  value: number;
}
```

=== Needed parameters === 

The D3 Bar-Chart representation needs some parameters that depend on the provided data: 
* Width and height : as a first step, a maximum height of 250px will be defined. The chart ratio will be 400x250px.
* Y Axis label: retrived from the description label provider. There is no label on the X axis.
* The data format: allows to compute the axis tick. See D3 Format for more details (https://github.com/d3/d3-format)
* (optional) Bars color.

=== GraphQL Schema ===

The GraphQL schema will be updated (currently named hierarchy.graphqls) with the new following types:

```
type BarChart implements Representation {
  id: ID!
  metadata: RepresentationMetadata!
  label: String!
  entries: [BarChartEntry!]!
}

type BarChartEntry {
  key: String!
  value: Float!
}
```
== Status

WIP.

== Consequences

A new bar-chart widget will be displayed in Form representations if the graphQL data contains a chartWidget.
