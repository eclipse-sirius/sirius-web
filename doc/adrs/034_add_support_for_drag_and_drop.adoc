= ADR-034 - Add support for drag and drop

== Context

We have introduce the unsynchronized diagram since the ADR-003.
To populate an unsynchronized diagram, we can use a standard `CreateNodeTool`.
But we can expect to drag an existing element from the model explorer.

== Decision

Based on the delete implementation, we will provide a `dropHandler` in the diagram description.

== Status

WIP

== Consequences

A `dropHandler` will be added to the available `DiagramDescription`:

```
public final class DiagramDescription implements IRepresentationDescription {

   //...

    private Function<VariableManager, Status> dropHandler;

    //...

}
```
