= ADR-035 - Add support for connector tool

== Context
A tool section with a lot of edge tools is not productive.
Indeed, we cannot filter effectively without source/target context.

In the following sample, we want to create a valid edge between A and B. C,D and E can be apply on A.
Without a good knowledge of the diagram description, we cannot presume if B is a valid target for these edge tools.

We select the C edge tool.
If we cannot create C, we must restart the process and try D or E without any guaranty to succeed.

We are lucky, C can be created :

We have all required data on the front-end side to filter valid edge tools on a given source/target context. We will provide a workflow to enhance the productivity named "magic edge tool".

== Decision

A *connector tool* re-use all available *create edge tools* and can be disabled by the specifier.

It allows to select the *source* and the *target* before to choose the concrete *create edge tool* to apply.

It is available when a source element is selected and if at least one *create edge tool* can be created on this source.

When it is engaged, we use a delegation pattern to detect a valid target. At least one underlying *create edge tool* should be valid to apply the *connector tool*.

If there are more than one remaining *create edge tool*, we display the filtered list (the selection apply the tool).
Otherwise, the remaining *create edge tool* is automatically apply.

== Status

WIP

== Consequences

We must choose between several options to integrate the *connector tool* in the diagram UX.

Option1: A static location on the contextual palette:

Option2: Option1 + hide existing create edge tools (light palette):

Option3: A new form on the selection sides:

Option4: Option3 + hide existing create edge tools (light palette):
