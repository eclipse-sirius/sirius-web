= ADR-XXX - Add support for backend-driven diagram customization

== Context

The current Sirius Web architecture handles diagram updates via a mix of frontend and backend logic tightly coupled to layout and rendering concerns.
No APIs are available to programmatically influence diagram content or behavior.

This architectural rigidity prevents advanced use cases such as automated transformations, semantic-aware or rule-based diagram evolution.

== Needs

We need to:

- Support structural changes like adding, removing, or modifying diagram elements.
- Allow injection of domain-specific logic while preserving compatibility with existing mechanisms (e.g., rendering, persistence, sync).
- Support composability and fallback to default behavior when not overridden.

Such extensibility is currently impossible due to tight coupling between the backend/frontend pipeline and layout-specific logic.

== Alternatives

=== [Frontend] Frontend-side customization
- Would require loading full diagram and semantic context client-side.
- Increased complexity and negative performance impact.
- Limited control over backend-managed logic.

=== [Backend] Backend-side customization
- Direct access to diagram and semantic data.
- Easier integration with rendering and persistence layers.
- Better performance and extensibility.

== Decision

We introduce an API mechanism in `DiagramCreationService` to allow post-processing of diagrams after they are created or updated.
This is done through a new interface, `IDiagramPostProcessor`, that lets us plug in custom logic easily.

The goal is to make it possible to adjust a diagram (layout and/or semantic changes, etc.) without modifying the core computation.

This approach is inspired by a similar mechanism already used for forms (`IFormPostProcessor`), and helps keep things simple and consistent.



=== API for custom diagram logic Providers

A new backend API is introduced to support domain-specific or diagram-type-specific strategies.
Furthermore, the specifier can define which specific actions (`IDiagramInput` interface) should trigger these custom logics, such as `EditLabelInput`, `DeleteFromDiagramInput`, etc.
This brings more flexibility to specifiers to adapt diagram/layout behavior to the needs of their diagrams or domain logic.

==== IDiagramPostProcessor interface

[source,java]
----
public interface IDiagramPostProcessor {

    /**
     * Applies custom logic to a diagram after creation or update.
     *
     * @param diagram The diagram to process
     * @param diagramDescription Optional diagram description (if already available)
     * @param diagramContext Optional context containing triggering information
     * @return The modified diagram
     */
    Diagram postProcess(Diagram diagram, Optional<DiagramDescription> diagramDescription, Optional<IDiagramContext> diagramContext);
}
----

=== DiagramPostProcessorRegistry

[source,java]
----
public class DiagramPostProcessorRegistry {

    private final List<IDiagramPostProcessor> postProcessors;

    /**
     * Applies all registered post-processors to the given diagram.
     *
     * @param diagram The diagram to process
     * @param diagramDescription Optional diagram description (if already available)
     * @param diagramContext Optional context containing triggering information
     * @return The modified diagram
     */
    public Diagram applyPostProcessors(Diagram diagram, Optional<DiagramDescription> diagramDescription, Optional<IDiagramContext> diagramContext);
}
----

==== Integration into DiagramCreationService

[source,java]
----
private final DiagramPostProcessorRegistry diagramPostProcessorRegistry;

    /**
     * Applies custom post-processing logic to the given diagram.
     *
     * @param diagram The diagram to process
     * @param diagramDescription Optional diagram description (if already available)
     * @param diagramContext Optional context containing triggering information
     * @return The modified diagram
     */
    private Diagram postProcess(Diagram diagram, Optional<DiagramDescription> diagramDescription, Optional<IDiagramContext> diagramContext);

=== No Frontend Modifications:

==== Overview

- The frontend `useLayout` already listens to `DiagramRefreshedEventPayload` from `DiagramEventFlux`, applying `NodeLayoutData` and `EdgeLayoutData` as computed server-side.

- In refresh scenarios, `useLayout` continues to resolve node/edge positions and overlaps based on the layout data provided by the backend.

- For layout scenarios like "Arrange All", `useArrangeAll` still triggers ELK layout locally, but the backend may override it using post-processing logic.
The final layout applied is always the backend's version, and `useLayout` renders it without interference.

- Font-based sizing remains handled on the frontend via existing layout handlers (e.g., `FreeFormNodeLayoutHandler`), which ensures compatibility with backend-computed positions.


==== Application scenarios

*Diagram creation*:
- The backend handles diagram construction and persistence.
- If defined, backend post-processors apply custom layout logic.
- The frontend renders the diagram using provided layout data.
- A layout mutation is triggered to confirm and persist the layout.

*Semantic changes*:
- Semantic operations (e.g., label edits, creation tools) trigger backend diagram refresh.
- A new diagram is created, updated, and persisted.
- Post-processors apply custom logic server-side.
- The frontend re-applies layout logic, but preserves any layout data already set.
- The layout mutation confirms and synchronizes positions.

*"Arrange All"*:
- The frontend computes a layout using ELK JS and sends it to the backend.
- The backend may override it through a post-processor.
- The frontend then applies layout as usual.
- A layout mutation is sent to persist the result.

*Move/Resize*:
- User interactions trigger a layout change sent to the backend.
- Post-processors may apply additional logic (optional).
- Final layout is persisted and applied by the frontend.



=== Handling "Arrange All" Blinking:

- When "Arrange All" is clicked, useArrangeAll applies ELK’s layout client-side, followed by the backend’s custom layout (if present), causing a brief blink as nodes reposition.

- This is deemed acceptable, as the blinking is transient and non-disruptive, avoiding the need for frontend changes to suppress ELK’s initial layout.

=== Limitations

*Frontend-Driven Sizing*:
- Font metrics and text-based layout are handled only in the frontend.
- Computing sizes backend-side would be complex and inconsistent; this remains unchanged.

=== Warning Points for API Implementors

*Coherence with Frontend*:
- Any backend customization must be compatible with frontend rendering behaviors (e.g., container resizing, label positioning).
- Layout logic should avoid breaking assumptions of the frontend layout engine to prevent visual artifacts or sync issues.

== Status

Draft.

== Consequences

=== Positive

- Allows injecting domain-specific or diagram-type-specific logic server-side.
- Uses existing frontend infrastructure without requiring modifications.
- Enables flexible chaining of multiple diagram custom logics.
- Maintains compatibility with frontend layout, rendering, and persistence.

=== Negative

- Adds complexity in backend diagram lifecycle, requiring careful alignment with frontend expectations.
- Some visual effects (like blinking on "Arrange All") may occur but are considered non-blocking.
