* https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker], which is used to run the PostgreSQL instance used as database. If you want to reuse an existing instance of PostgreSQL (version 12 or later), ensure the database user has admin rights on the database.

* A Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 17

TIP: If you do not already have a JRE installed on your system, we recommend getting started with one of the builds made available by https://adoptium.net/[Eclipse Adoptium].

* A modern web browser

TIP: Sirius Web currently has some known issues with Firefox. We recommend using a Chromium-based browser if needed.
