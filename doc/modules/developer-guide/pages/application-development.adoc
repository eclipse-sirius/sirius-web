= Application Development

#TODO: This should explain how to create a custom application that embeds the Sirius Web runtime.
Previously we'd just fork sirius-web-sample-application and tweak it a bit.
I think now there might be a framework we can rely upon.#

Maybe use:

* Backend: https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/tree/master/packages/sirius-web/backend/sirius-web
* Frontend: https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/tree/master/packages/sirius-web/frontend/sirius-web
* https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/master/doc/explanation/evolution-of-the-sirius-web-architecture.adoc
