= Requirements

== System Requirements

Developing for {sw} can be done on any modern OS.

While developing, you might need to run both the backend and frontend of {sw} on your machine, so a good amount of available RAM is recommended.

#TODO: is there anything specific about network requirements we should detail here?#

== Tool Requirements

* Git: #TODO: not sure we need Git with the framework approach to custom application#
* *Github account*: to access the {sw} Maven and npm packages https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-sirius/packages?repo_name=sirius-web[hosted on Github Packages]
* *Docker*: to run the https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL v12] instance used as database
* Apache *Maven* v3.6.3: to build the backend
* *Java* v17: to run the backend
* *NPM* v8.15.0 & TurboRepo: to build the frontend
* *Node.js* v18.7.0: to run the frontend

NOTE: You can also run your own PostgreSQL 12 instance without Docker. In that case, make sure the database user has admin rights on the database.

== Know-how 

=== Backend

The {sw} backend relies on the following technologies:

* Implementation:
** https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/[Java 17]
** https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot framework]
** (Optional) Modelization with the https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.emf.emf[Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)]
** (Optional) https://graphql.org[GraphQL]
** Nice-to-have: knowledge of https://eclipse.dev/sirius[Sirius Desktop], because many {sw} concepts in _{stddefs}_ are similar to concepts found in https://eclipse.dev/sirius/doc/specifier/Sirius%20Specifier%20Manual.html[Sirius Desktop Specifications].

* Build & Artifacts: https://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven v3.6.3]
* Runtime: any Java Runtime Environment (JRE) v17

TIP: If you do not already have a JRE installed on your system, we recommend getting started with one of the builds made available by https://adoptium.net/[Eclipse Adoptium].

=== Frontend

The {sw} frontend relies on the following technologies:

* Implementation: https://react.dev[React]
* Build & Artifacts: https://www.npmjs.com[npm] v8.15.0
* Runtime: https://nodejs.org[Node.js] v18.7.0

NOTE: Most {sw} APIs are on the backend, so for most _{stddevs}_, only the frontend runtime is necessary.
