= Studio Runtime for Developers

As explained in the xref:user-manual:studio-runtime.adoc[User Manual], the _{stdrt}_ is the runtime engine responsible for interpreting _{stddefs}_ into an editing experience for the _{stdusrs}_.

There are however some elements of this runtime that can be programmatically configured. This chapter will thus focus on going further into the lifecycle of the _{stdrt}_, and the APIs that can be used to configure it.

#TODO: Not sure how much we have here.

Probably there are some APIs that we can use to configure some parameters of the runtime?

#TODO: Add tip to add delay for the resource set to get disposed, very useful when developing to set this lower.#
