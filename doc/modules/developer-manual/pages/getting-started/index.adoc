= Getting Started

Before getting started with Sirius Web, we recommend xref:developer-manual:getting-started/development-environment/index.adoc[setting up your development environment].

If you do not already have a web application into which your custom studio will be integrated, then consider also xref:developer-manual:getting-started/blueprint-application/index.adoc[setting up your blueprint application].

Once your environment is setup, and your application is ready to integrate your custom studio, you can follow one of the xref:developer-manual:getting-started/tutorials/index.adoc[available tutorials].
