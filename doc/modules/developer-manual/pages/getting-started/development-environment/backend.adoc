= Backend

#TODO: Explain how to setup the recommended devenv for the backend.#

* Essentially same as the devenv for contributors, i.e. STS + Maven + docker
* Probably also add procedure on how to clear the database to start from scratch

#TODO: which repository to clone?
For now we have to clone sirius-web and then only use a subset of it (~ sample application + our modules)
But later on we will have a blueprint we can fork.
Probably wait for the ongoing refactoring work to be completed before writing this section.#
