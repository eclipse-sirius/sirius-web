= For Studio Developers

== Development

#TODO: to be able to hot reload in STS, set classpath entry "output" to "target/classes" instead of "bin". Maybe M2e would help support this?#

== Build

#TODO: never build in the command-line at the same time as in STS.#

== Tests

#TODO: run Cypress tests from a built artefact and not from the runtime.#
