== Introduction

{sw} is an Eclipse project which allows you to easily create *your own cloud-based graphical modeling studio*.

It provides a _generic workbench_ for model-based architecture engineering that can easily be tailored to fit specific needs. Ouf of the box, this generic workbench supports various kinds of more-or-less graphical representations, including *diagrams*, *forms* and *trees*.

{sw} is the cloud-based version of the {sirius-website}[Eclipse Sirius project].


=== Purpose

{sw} is both a _framework_ for the creation of custom domain-specific cloud-based studios, and a _runtime_ for their deployment :

* As a framework, its goal is to *facilitate and accelerate the implementation of modeling studios* by supporting, out of the box, a variety of representation types for your domain-specific data. This allows _{stdmkrs}_ and/or _{stddevs}_ to create editors which are intuitive, feature-rich and fit the knowledge and workflow of the domain experts.

* As a runtime, it leverages *modern web technologies* to provide an efficient user experience, and supports many productivity-enhancing features out of the box.

Both the framework and runtime aspects of {sw} are *highly extensible*, making it a great platform both for quick and dirty prototypes as well as full-fledged products.


=== Key features and benefits

* A *low-code* approach for creating and editing custom modeling studios, to enable simple use cases or prototypes.
* A powerful and extensible *programmatic* approach for creating and editing custom modeling studios, to enable more complex featureful customized applications.
* A flexible runtime, that can be deployed either as a *standalone web application*, or easily *integrated* into another web application.
* Developed in xref:ROOT:introduction/sources.adoc[open-source] and under a xref:ROOT:introduction/governance.adoc[vendor-neutral] foundation, to ensure that your data is and remains yours.
