= Create Instance

A `Create Instance` is an `{view-operation-x}` that creates a new model element contained by the contextual element.

This is useful for mutating the semantic model as a result of user interaction.

#TODO: Apparently in {sw}, contrary to Sirius Desktop, `Create Instance` does not change the context. We should check that it is the current behavior, and that it is not a bug. If so, probably add a WARNING admonition here, and fix the examples below.#
