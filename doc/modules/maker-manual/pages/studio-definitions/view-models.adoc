= {view-models}

== Overview

In a _{mkr-studio-definition}_, the _{view-model}_ defines how, xref:user-manual:studio-runtime.adoc[at runtime], domain-specific data conforming to the _{mkr-data-models}_ is to be *represented* and *edited* through {sw} _{usr-representations}_.

NOTE: In fact, *_{view-model}_* is actually a particular _{usr-data-model}_ that is made available in all _{mkr-studio-projects}_.

A _{view-model}_ is composed of several `{view-view-x}`. Each `{view-view}` is contains a list of so-called `{view-representationdescription-x}`.
At runtime, each _{representation}_ stems from the application of a `{view-representationdescription}` onto a {usr-model}.

NOTE: Most of the time, a _{view-model}_ will focus on providing _{representations}_ that focus on the _{data-model}_ contributed alongside it as part of the {stddef}. But there are no technical restrictions, so a _{view-model}_ could just as easily provide _{representations}_ for other _{data-models}_ available in the platform.

Each `{view-view}` is a pre-defined, finite, set of `{view-representationdescription}`. Usually the scoping of a `{view-view}` is determined based on the intended audience: depending on the role of the _{stdusr}_ in the organization (e.g. architect, engineering, quality assurance, etc.), different means of visualizing and editing the same set of domain-specific data may be more appropriate.

TIP: In some communities, this approach is known as _Viewpoints_ or _Perspectives_.

== Editor

#TODO: Not sure if this is the right location for this section.#

As a _{stdmkr}_, the _{view-model}_ is edited through a dedicated editor embedded in {sw}.

In this editor, edition happens through fields in the {usr-ui-details} tab. Most importantly, _some_ of the text fields rely on a specific syntax. They are identified by their background color, which differs from the default (white).

=== Type Literals

Text fields with a light green background expect a `Type literal`, that is, that the String entered by the {stdmkr} conforms to one of the valid syntaxes for referencing a type from one of the contributed _{usr-data-models}_ of the platform.

The following syntaxes are allowed:
[source, bash]
----
typeName <1>
packageName::typeName <2>
packageName.typeName <2>
----
<1> A type name, if there is no ambiguity, i.e. no two types of different packages with the same name.
<2> A type name, preceded by the name of the package that contains it, separated by `::` or `.`.

When editing this kind of text field, the content assist can be brought up using keyboard shortcut `CTRL+SPACE`.

Suggestions are based on the Data Models available in the platform, and the text preceding the cursor location.


=== Queries

Text fields with a light yellow background expect a `Query literal`, that is, that the String entered by the {stdmkr} is a valid _{mkr-query}_.

Moreover, the content assist can be brought up using keyboard shortcut `CTRL+SPACE`.
