= Portal Description

A `Portal Description` defines how the _{usr-studio-runtime}_ creates xref:user-manual:studio-runtime/representation-editors/portal.adoc[Portal Representations].

This type of representation description is a bit particular, as _{stdmkrs}_ may not create their own as part of their _{stddef}_.

The single, generic, instance of `Portal Description` is contributed to the _{stddef}_ whenever the 'portal feature' is enabled for {sw} (which is the case with the default configuration). The application administrator may choose to disable it in order to prevent users from creating and manipulating Portal representations.

Refer to the xref:user-manual:studio-runtime/representation-editors/portal.adoc#[Studio Runtime] documentation for how _Studio Users_ can create `Portal Representations`.
