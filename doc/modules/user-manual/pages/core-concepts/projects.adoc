= {projects}

== Purpose

In the {sw} workbench, *_{projects}_* are the base organizational unit for the user data. They serve as top-level containers for the _{usr-models}_, which in turn contain the _{usr-objects}_ and _{usr-representations}_.

A _{project}_ always has a name that consists of between 3 and 1024 characters.

== {natures}

A *_{nature}_* is a _{project}_ metadata used to tailor the user experience to the usage intended for the _{project}_. _{projects}_ may be tagged with one or several _{natures}_. 

_{natures}_ are created by the _{stddevs}_ and usually contributed alongside the _{usr-data-models}_.

The _{natures}_ of a _{project}_ are not visible to _{stdusrs}_ and _{stdmkrs}_. Only _{stddevs}_ may see them.

By default, {sw} provides the following _{natures}_:

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|*{nature}*
|*ID*
|*Purpose*

|[[project-nature-studio]]Studio
|`siriusComponents://nature?kind=studio`
|Identifies the _{mkr-studio-projects}_, which are the _{projects}_ used by _{stdmkrs}_ and _{stddevs}_ to define the contributed custom _{usr-data-models}_ and _{usr-view-models}_.

A _{project}_ with this {nature} can reference *all* _{data-models}_ of the platform, and in particular the ones used as part of _{stddefs}_: _{usr-domain}_ and _{usr-view}_.
|===

Custom applications based on {sw} may provide their own sets of _{natures}_ to further categorize _{projects}_ and possibly enrich the user experience.


== {templates}

A *_{template}_* is a pre-made _{project}_ that can be easily created by a _{stdusr}_. Its goal is to facilitate the creation of a particular _{project}_, usually in order to quickly get started on a particular use case of a domain, or to showcase the depth and breadth of possibilities offered by a custom studio. _{projects}_ created through _{templates}_ usually contain representative samples of _{usr-models}_ and _{usr-representations}_.

_{templates}_ are created by the _{stddevs}_ and usually contributed alongside the _{usr-data-models}_.

In the _{usr-ui-workbench}_, _{templates}_ are by default listed at the top of the _{usr-ui-homepage}_. With a single click, a new project populated with its domain-specific data and representations is created.

By default, {sw} provides the following _{templates}_:

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|*{template}*
|*ID*
|*Purpose*

^a|[[project-template-studio-blank]]Blank Studio
image:Project-Template_BlankStudio.png["Snapshot of the `Blank Studio` {template}"]
|`blank-studio-template`
|Used by _{stdmkrs}_ to create a new and empty {mkr-studio-project}.

^a|[[project-template-studio]]Studio
image:Project-Template_Studio.png["Snapshot of the `Studio` {template}"]
|`studio-template`
|Used by _{stdmkrs}_ to create a new {mkr-studio-project} with a simple example of _{usr-data-model}_ and _{usr-view-model}_.
|===

Although most of the time, _{templates}_ focus on a particular {data-model} and as such are provided alongside it, custom applications based on {sw} may provide their own sets of _{templates}_, for their own {data-models} or for existing ones.


== {stereotypes}

A *_{stereotype}_* is a bit like a _{template}_, but for _{usr-models}_. It is a pre-made _{model}_ that can be easily created into an existing _{project}_. Its goal is usually to allow _{stdusrs}_ to quickly get started with a _{model}_ that has a particular structure, or to showcase the depth and breadth of possibilities offered by a custom _{usr-data-model}_.

_{stereotypes}_ are created by _{stddevs}_ and usually contributed alongside the _{usr-data-models}_.

In the _{usr-ui-workbench}_, _{stereotypes}_ are by default available through xref:user-manual:workbench-ui/project-homepage/project-editor.adoc#_create_a_new_model[the left pane of the {ui-view-project-editor}].

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|*{stereotype}*
|*Condition*
|*Purpose*

|Domain
|Contextual _{project}_ has the _xref:user-manual:core-concepts.adoc#project-nature-studio[Studio]_ _{nature}_
|Creates a new _{model}_ with an empty `Domain` (from _{usr-domain}_).

|View
|Context _{project}_ has the _xref:user-manual:core-concepts.adoc#project-nature-studio[Studio]_ _{nature}_
|Creates a new _{model} with an empty `View` (from _{usr-view}_).
|===

Like _{templates}_, _{stereotypes}_ usually focus on a particular {data-model} and as such are provided alongside it. Still, custom applications based on {sw} may provide their own sets of _{stereotypes}_, for their own {data-models} or for existing ones.


== Lifecycle

_{projects}_ are most often managed directly by _{stdusrs}_ through the _{usr-ui-workbench}_.
They can also be managed programmatically by _{stddevs}_.

=== Creation

_{projects}_ can be created in the workbench by either:

* xref:user-manual:workbench-ui/workbench-homepage.adoc#project-create[Creating] a new empty _{project}_.
* Using one of the _{usr-project-templates}_ made available by the platform.
* xref:user-manual:workbench-ui/workbench-homepage.adoc#project-upload[Uploading] an existing _{project}_. The uploaded file must conform to one of the xref:user-manual:core-concepts/projects.adoc#_export[supported import/export formats].

=== Edition

_{projects}_ can be edited by opening them from the {usr-ui-workbench}.

Inside a _{project}_, the {usr-ui-project-editor} is used to edit its contents.

All _{projects}_ can be edited by all _{stdusrs}_.

=== Deletion

_{projects}_ can be deleted by either:

* Using the xref:user-manual:workbench-ui/workbench-homepage.adoc#project-list[_{project}_ contextual menu action from the {ui-view-homepage}].
* Using the xref:user-manual:workbench-ui/project-homepage/project-toolbar.adoc#project-delete[_{project}_ contextual menu action from the {ui-view-project-toolbar}].

All _{projects}_ can be deleted from the workbench by all _{stdusrs}_.

=== Export

_{projects}_ can be exported by either:

* Using the xref:user-manual:workbench-ui/workbench-homepage.adoc#project-list[_{project}_ contextual menu action from the {ui-view-homepage}].
* Using the xref:user-manual:workbench-ui/project-homepage/project-toolbar.adoc#project-delete[_{project}_ contextual menu action from the {ui-view-project-toolbar}].

All _{projects}_ can be exported and downloaded by all _{stdusrs}_.

#TODO: I think at some point we need to make explicit the serialization format used by the exporter.#

#TODO: Explain limitations of the "Download Project" feature, in particular for de-synchronized diagrams.#
