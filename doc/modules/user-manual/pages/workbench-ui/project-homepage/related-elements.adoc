= Related Elements

The *Related Elements* tab in the right sidebar of the _xref:user-manual:workbench-ui/project-homepage.adoc[]_ displays other project elements related to the currently-selected _Object_. It also allows quickly navigating to these related elements.

Related project elements are classified into three root categories:

* image:Related-Elements_Incoming.png["{ui-view-related}" Tab Incoming Icon]: for project elements referencing the selected object.
* image:Related-Elements_Current.png["{ui-view-related}" Tab Current Icon]: for project elements closely related to the selected object.
* image:Related-Elements_Outgoing.png["{ui-view-related}" Tab Outgoing Icon]: for project elements referenced by the selected object.

IMPORTANT: The related elements are computed according to the rules provided by the _{usr-data-model}_ to which the selected object conforms.

A root category is represented as a tree. There are no restrictions on the width or depth of the tree.

* The root of the tree is the name of the category.
* The project elements related to the currently-selected object are the leaves of the tree.
* Intermediary nodes may be used to further organize the related elements.

By default, all root categories are active, but clicking on a category hides the elements belonging to this category:
