= Explorer

The *Explorer* view is one of the views in the left sidebar of the generic workbench UI.

.The _{ui-view-explorer}_ view
image::Explorer.png["{ui-view-explorer} sample snapshot"]

It represents and allows the edition, through a tree structure, of the contents of the project.

In this tree structure:

* The root elements are the _{usr-models}_ of the project.
* The children elements of a _Model_ are its _Objects_.
* The children elements of an _Object_ are:
** Its children _Objects_, as defined by the _Data Model_ it conforms to
** The _xref:user-manual:core-concepts.adoc#_representations[Representations]_ whose target is the _Object_ itself.
* _Representations_ are *always* _leaves_ of the tree.
* Each node (_Model_, _Object_ or _Representation_) is represented by an *icon* and a *label*. For an _Object_, they are provided by the _Data Model_ contributing the corresponding element.
* The current selection is highlighted by the light pink background color.

When an element from the *Explorer* view is selected and in focus, keyboard shortcut `CTRL+F` opens a text popup that can be used to search for elements whose labels matches the given text.

By default, the matching text among label elements is highlighted in the tree.
