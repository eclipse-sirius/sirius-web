= Studio Runtime

The _{stdrt}_ is the engine that takes a _xref:maker-manual:studio-definitions.adoc[{stddef}]_ and interprets it as a modeling studio as part of a cloud-based application. Most of the results of this interpretation ends up as contributions to the xref:user-manual:workbench-ui.adoc[].
