= Acceleo Query Language (AQL)

The previous possibilities to express queries were very simple, for practical purposes.

In order to express more complex queries in the form of expressions, Sirius Web relies on the https://eclipse.dev/acceleo/documentation/aql.html[Acceleo Query Language (AQL)].
It is a powerful, expressive and extensible query language.

In fact, at runtime, Sirius Web will transform any query into an equivalent AQL query for execution.
Therefore, the examples that we have seen before can also by adapted into AQL:

.AQL equivalent to the query by variable name
====
*aql:* myVariableName
====

.AQL equivalent to the query by feature name
====
*aql:* self.myFeatureName
====

.AQL equivalent to the query by service name
====
*aql:* self.myServiceName()
====

#TODO: There should probably be more infos here. Maybe some examples?#
