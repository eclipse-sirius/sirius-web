= Queries

In Sirius Web, when specifying a xref:user-manual:reference-documentation/studio-definition/view-model/index.adoc[View Model], we need to be able to express *queries* in order to navigate over semantic and graphical elements.

There are 4 ways to express queries.
3 are for simple straightforward navigation, which usually suffice for simple cases.
The last one is a full-on expression language that provides the expressivity required for rich navigation over complex and/or large data models.
