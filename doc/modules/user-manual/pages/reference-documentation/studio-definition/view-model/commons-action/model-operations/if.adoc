= If

An `If` operation defines a sub-operation which is only executed if the conditional expression evaluates to `True`.

This is useful when some behavior need to be executed only when certain conditions are met.

#TODO: It seems that in a diagram, if the `If` conditional expression returns `void`, Sirius Web interprets it as an error. This was not the case in Sirius Desktop. If this is not a bug, add a WARNING admonition here. Current workaround is to append `= null` to the expression.#

== Examples

.Conditionally changing the contextual element from `o1` to `o2`
====

.Variables before
------
"self" : o1
"object1" : o1
"object2" : o2
------

.Operation
------
If(conditionExpression: "aql:true")
    ChangeContext(expression: "var:object2")
------

.Variables after
------
"self" : o2
"object1" : o1
"object2" : o2
------
====

#TODO: I think we should have a nicer way to represent a tree of model operations.#
