= Change Context

A `Change Context` operation changes the current contextual element.

This is useful for performing several model operations on a same element, especially if it required a navigation query to reach.

#TODO: It seems that in a diagram, if the `ChangeContext` expression returns `void`, Sirius Web interprets it as an error. This was not the case in Sirius Desktop. If this is not a bug, add a WARNING admonition here. Current workaround is to append `= null` to the expression.#
