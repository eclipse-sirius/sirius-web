= Delete View

NOTE: This operation is specific to xref:user-manual:reference-documentation/studio-runtime/view-model/representation-diagram/index.adoc[Diagram Representations].

A `Delete View` operation deletes a graphical element from a diagram. The semantic element remains in the model. Other graphical elements targetting the same semantic element remain.

This is useful for removing a graphical element in a diagram as a result of a user interaction.
