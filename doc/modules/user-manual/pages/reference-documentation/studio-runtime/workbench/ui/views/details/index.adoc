#TODO: Add a representative snapshot of the "Details" view.#

The *Details* view is one of the views on the rightmost pane of the workbench UI.

Through a xref:user-manual:reference-documentation/studio-runtime/view-model/representation-form/index.adoc[Form Representation], it represents and allows the edition of a _contextual element_. Which is usually the currently-selected _semantic element_ in the workbench, but not always.
