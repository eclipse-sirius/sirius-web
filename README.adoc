= Sirius Components (for Sirius Web)

https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/sirius-web.html[Eclipse Sirius Web] is a framework to easily create and deploy studios to the web.
We keep the principles which made the success of https://www.eclipse.org/sirius[Eclipse Sirius Desktop] and make them available on a modern cloud-based stack.

This repository, `sirius-components`, contains the building blocks from which Sirius Web applications are built:

* `frontend` contains reusable React components used to build the application's UI;
* `backend` contains the Spring Boot projects from which the corresponding backend is built.

To actually build and run a complete example application, see https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web[the `sirius-web` repository] which contains a complete example of a Sirius Web modeler built using these components.

== Building

=== Requirements

To build the components in this repository on your own, you will need the following tools installed:

* Git, and a GitHub account
* To build the backend components:
** Java 11 (Java 12 or later are currently not supported)
** https://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven 3.6.3]
* To build the frontend components:
** Recent versions of https://nodejs.org/[Node and NPM]: in particular, Node >= 16.6 is required along with npm >= 7.20.
** https://rollupjs.org/[rollup] (`npm install -g rollup`)
** https://github.com/whitecolor/yalc[yalc] (`npm install -g yalc`)

WARNING: Note that there are issues with NPM under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
If you use WSL and encounter error messages like _"Maximum call stack size exceeded"_ when running NPM, switch to plain Windows where this should work.

=== GitHub Access Token

The backend part of _Sirius Components_ depends on https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-emf-json[`sirius-emf-json`], which is published as Maven artifacts in _GitHub Packages_.
To build `sirius-components` locally, you need a _GitHub Access Token_ so that Maven can download the `sirius-emf-json` and `Flow-Designer` artifacts.

. Create a personal token with a scope of `read:package` by following https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token[the GitHub documentation] if you do not have one already.
+
WARNING: Once generated, a token cannot be displayed anymore, so make sure to copy it in a secure location.
. Create or edit `$HOME/.m2/settings.xml` to tell Maven to use this token when accessing the Sirius EMF JSON repository:
+
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>github-sirius-emfjson</id>
      <username>$GITHUB_USERNAME</username>
      <password>$GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>github-flow</id>
      <username>$GITHUB_USERNAME</username>
      <password>$GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
----
+
Be sure to replace `$GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub user id, and `$GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the value of your acess token.
+
IMPORTANT: The `id` used in your `settings.xml` *must* be `github-sirius-emfjson` and `github-flow` to match what is used in the POMs.

=== Build steps

1. Clone the Sirius Components repository:
+
[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components.git
----
2. Build the frontend components.
From the `frontend` directory:
+
----
npm ci
npm run build
----
+
NOTE: You may see some warnings when building the frontend (skipped optional dependencies during `npm ci`, circular dependencies detected on an indirect dependency during the build).
You can ignore them, they do not cause any actual issue at runtime.
3. Publish the built version of the frontend components locally.
Still from inside `sirius-components/frontend`: 
+
[source,sh]
----
yalc publish
----
+
NOTE: This step is not strictly needed but will allow you to consume your locally built version of the frontend components if you want to build a complete Sirius Web studio using them without publishing them to an external NPM registry.
4. Build the backend components.
From the `sirius-components/backend` directory:
+
[source,sh]
----
mvn clean install
----
+
TIP: If you are behind a proxy, you may get Maven errors about checkstyle.org not being available.
In this case you need to explicitly disable CheckStyle from the build: `mvn clean install -f releng/org.eclipse.sirius.emfjson.releng/pom.xml -P\!checkstyle`
