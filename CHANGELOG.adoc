=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5684[#5684] `IToolService`, `org.eclipse.sirius.components.diagrams.tools` and `ToolConverter` have been removed.
Tools are no longer converted with the diagram.
You can use `IViewToolFinder` to find a node or edge tool in a view dsl.
`IToolDiagramExecutor` has been rename to `ISingleClickOnOneDiagramElementHandler` and `ISingleClickOnTwoDiagramElementHandler` has been added, these interface are used to execute a tool from the `InvokeSingleClickOnDiagramElementToolEventHandler` and `InvokeSingleClickOnTwoDiagramElementsToolEventHandler`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3486[#3486] Nodes and edges have a new `deletable` attribute in the GraphQL Schema that custom nodes must consider in their converter.
On the backend, the node and edge's `deleteHandler` can now be `null` if no semantic deletion tool is defined for this element.
`IViewNodeDeleteHandler`, which only existed to provide a non-null handler able to tell if there was a semantic deletion tool, has been removed.
https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5782[#5782] [diagram] The input `GetPaletteInput` will now require a list of diagram element ids instead of a single one to retrieve a palette for multiple elements selected at once.
In a similar manner, `InvokeSingleClickOnDiagramElementToolInput` will now ask for a list of diagram element ids to execute a tool on multiple elements are once
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5942[#5942] The signature of the method `canHandle` of the various event handlers has changed: it now takes the `IEditingContext` as a parameter in addition to the `input`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5272[#5272] The parameter `representationId` has been removed from the API `ITreeFilterProvider#get`.
The `ExplorerRepresentationMetadataProvider` has been updated to provide only the metadata for the default Sirius-Web explorer.
Each custom explorer definition will now be in control of its metadata.
For that, custom explorers must provide their own implementation of `IRepresentationMetadataProvider`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5507[#5507] [form] All form based GraphQL subscription using the type `FormRefreshedEventPayload` may need to also add `FormCapabilitiesRefreshedEventPayload` to their union.
React components `FormRepresentation`, `DiagramFilterForm`, `DetailsView`, `RelatedElementsView`, and `RepresentationsView` stopped relying on `readOnly` props in favor of the `FormCapabilities#canEdit` capabilities.
All tests based on form subscriptions will now receive both `FormRefreshedEventPayload` and `FormCapabilitiesRefreshedEventPayload`.
Those tests will have to be updated to take this new payload into account.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5174[#5174] The `createProjectFromTemplate` mutation and all associated types (e.g. `CreateProjectFromTemplateInput` and `CreateProjectFromTemplateSuccessPayload`) and test helpers (`CreateProjectFromTemplateMutationRunner`) have been removed.
The ability to specify a project template when creating a project is now integrated directly into the main `createProject` mutation, through the new `templateId` field in `CreateProjectInput`.
As part of this change, creating a project from a template can no longer automatically open an initial representation, but this feature will be reintroduced through a different mechanism.
The ability to specify the natures of the project to be created has been removed from the GraphQL schema along with the natures of a project template and the related DTOs since this concern is now handled internally thanks to the project template.
The lifecycle of the initialization of the projects has been simplified compared to the previous version which was taking some shortcut with the proper lifecycle of the application.
As a consequence, the interface `IProjectTemplateInitializer` has been renamed to `ISemanticDataInitializer` and it will only be in charge of the creation of the semantic data of a project.
It previously was used to manipulate both the semantic data and the representation bounded contexts.
Now each `ISemanticDataInitializer` will be in charge of calling the `IEditingContextPersistenceService` to save the semantic data updated thanks to the project template.
This responsibility has been transfered to the semantic data initializer in order to offer the possibility to provide a custom cause for the persistence of the semantic data.
Since the lifecycle now matches our best practices, the creation of some initial representation by a template will have to be performed in another service listening for the relevant event.
By having the ability to specify a custom event, one can provide some custom data between the service creating the semantic data and the one creating the representations.
An example is visible in `StudioSemanticDataInitializer` and `StudioRepresentationInitializer`.
On top of that a new interface, `IRestDefaultProjectTemplateProvider`, is available for those who want to specify the default template to use when a project is created thanks to the rest API.
This API will probably slightly evolve in the futur but it provides today the ability to change the project created from the default "Blank Project".
On the frontend, the `ProjectTemplateCard` component has been removed; the `NewProjectCard` component handles all cases now, with a new `template` prop.

=== New Features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5806[#5806] [sirius-web] Add a command in the projects omnibox to perform cross-project queries.
The command relies on Elasticsearch's _query string_, which provides syntactical constructs to query fields, use wildcards, regular expressions, and fuzziness.
You can check the https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-query-string-query#query-string-syntax[documentation] for more information, including a list of reserved characters and how to escape them.
The command is only visible if Elasticsearch is up and running.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5808[#5808] [sirius-web] Refactor index lifecycle to support multiple editing contexts.
Downstream applications can now implement the following interfaces:
* `IIndexCreationServiceDelegate` to customize how indexes are created
* `IIndexDeletionServiceDelegate` to customize how indexes are deleted
* `IIndexUpdateServiceDelegate` to customize how the content of the indices is updated
Sirius Web provides a default implementation for all these services, which creates an index per editing context, and indexes all the features of the elements in the editing context (this can be customized by implementing `IIndexEntryProviderDelegate`).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3486[#3486] [diagram] Do not open delete confirmation dialog when a node/edge is not deletable

=== Deprecation warning



=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4134[#4134] [core] Our custom `EditingContextCrossReferenceAdapter` has been removed and replaced by EMF's default `ECrossReferenceAdapter`.
Use `org.eclipse.emf.ecore.util.ECrossReferenceAdapter.getCrossReferenceAdapter(Notifier)` to obtain it instead of looking for an `EditingContextCrossReferenceAdapter`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5015[#5015] [sirius-web] Add the ability to duplicate projects.
The project duplication feature has been implemented as an export of the project and then a import of the project.
The code responsible for the import has been refactor with:
* `IProjectImportService` has been renamed in `IProjectImportApplicationService`.
* `ProjectImporter` no longer exist. Its code has been split among `IProjectContentImportParticipant`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5599[#5599] [sirius-web] `IProjectExportService` and `IProjectExportParticipant` now takes the id of the _EditingContext_ to export as a parameter.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5565[#5565] [sirius-web] Add support for removing a dependency to an imported library.
* `ISingleClickTreeItemContextMenuEntryExecutor#execute` (and its implementations) now requires an additional `ITreeInput` parameter which is used to differentiate regular entry execution from impact analysis ones
* `InvokeDiagramImpactAnalysisToolEventHandler` has been moved to `org.eclipse.sirius.web.application.impactanalysis.services` to match Sirius Web's architecture
* `InvokeTreeImpactAnalysisToolEventHandler` has been moved to `org.eclipse.sirius.web.application.impactanalysis.services` to match Sirius Web's architecture
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5640[#5640] [diagram] A new flag `movedByUser` has been added to the node data.
This flag must be set in custom node converter, an example can be found in `EllipseNodeConverter.ts`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5748[#5748] [sirius-web] Add the list of libraries to import to the hook that create a project.
* https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5735[#5735] [sirius-web] Prepare merging `CreateProjectInput` and `CreateProjectFromTemplateInput`.
For now it consists only in adding missing attributes from `CreateProjectInput` in `CreateProjectFromTemplateInput`, using the project template label as the `CreateProjectFromTemplateInput#name` and project template natures as the `CreateProjectFromTemplateInput#natures`.
As described in ADR-211, the final purpose is to only have one way to create a project, and thus, only one input to create a project will remain.
Updates the GraphQL schema and frontend hooks accordingly.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5368[#5368] [table] The extension point for adding global actions to a table has been renamed from `settingButtonMenuEntryExtensionPoint` to `toolsButtonMenuEntryExtensionPoint`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5745[#5745] [sirius-web] Change the input to create a project and update the GraphQL schema accordingly.
- [core] Update the signature of `IconOverlay` by renaming the props `iconURL` to `iconURLs` to highlight the fact that a collection of URLs is expected.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5722[#5722] [core] Decouple the omnibox from the workbench
The `omnibox.graphqls` schema has been changed to make explicit the fact that the current APIs are aimed at the integration of the omnibox in the workbench:

[source, graphqls]
----
extend type Viewer {
  workbenchOmniboxSearch(editingContextId: ID!, selectedObjectIds: [ID!]!, query: String!): ViewerOmniboxCommandsConnection!
  workbenchOmniboxCommands(editingContextId: ID!, selectedObjectIds: [ID!]!, query: String!): ViewerOmniboxCommandsConnection!
}
----

Most of the backend/frontend code that manipulate omnibox commands have been renamed to reflect this change.

The signature of the `Omnibox` component has been changed to make it configurable:
[source, typescript]
----
export interface OmniboxProps {
  open: boolean;
  loading: boolean;
  commands: GQLOmniboxCommand[] | null;
  onQuery: (query: string, mode: OmniboxMode) => void;
  onCommandClick: (command: GQLOmniboxCommand, mode: OmniboxMode) => void;
  onClose: () => void;
}
----
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5603[#5603] Add a tree visualization of the impacts in the impact analysis dialog.
The following files have been moved from the frontend module `sirius-components-core` to `sirius-components-impactanalysis` to avoid circular dependencies:
* `ImpactAnalysisDialog.tsx`
* `ImpactAnalysisDialog.types.ts`
* `useImpactAnalysisDialog.tsx`
* `useImpactAnalysisDialog.types.ts`

The `ImpactAnalysisReport` GraphQL type has been updated to contain `impactTree: DataTree!`, the corresponding query hooks and backend code has been updated to consume and provide this new value.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5766[#5766] [diagram] `DiagramElementPalette` is no longer exported, when using custom nodes, the palette will still be opened when right clicking an element.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5563[#5563] [diagram] `RectangularNodeAppearanceSection`, `ImageNodeAppearanceSection` and `EdgeAppearanceSection` are no longer hard-coded in the frontend, but contribute via the  `paletteAppearanceSectionExtensionPoint`.
If you are not contributing custom appearance sections, no action is required.
Otherwise, you may need to add a merge strategy to merge the two contributions.
The extension point signature has also changed to take edges into account: `canHandle: (node: Node<NodeData> | undefined, edge: Edge<EdgeData> | undefined) => boolean;`.
And the props of `PaletteAppearanceSectionContributionComponentProps` has been renamed from `elementId` to `diagramElementId`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5673[#5673] [emf] Both `IRepresentationDescriptionConverter` and `IViewConverter` convert methodz now return `ViewConverterResult` and a `list of ViewConverterResult`.
`ViewConverterResult` contains the converted `IRepresentationDescription`.
The convert method signature of IViewConverter has been modified to `List<ViewConverterResult> convert(IEMFEditingContext editingContext, List<View> views)`;
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5002[#5002] [sirius-web] Tree based representations have always enjoyed some hardcoded entries in the context menu.
Those menu entries are not hardcoded in the frontend anymore and, just like in diagrams, will be retrieved from the backend.
As a result, specifiers who want to reuse some of those menu entries of the Sirius Web explorer will have to provide `SingleClickTreeItemContextMenuEntry` with specific values for `id`.
The values in questions are accessible thanks to public constants in `ExplorerTreeItemContextMenuEntryProvider` with `expand-all`, `new-root-object`, `download-document`, `new-object`, `new-representation`, `duplicate-object`, `duplicate-representation`, `update-library`, `remove-library`.
This mechanisms was previously used to provide the menu entry to update/remove a library with the identifier `updateLibrary` / `removeLibrary` and which have been updated to be aligned with the other identifiers with `update-library`, `remove-library`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5802[#5802] [tree] `ISingleClickTreeItemContextMenuEntryExecutor#canExecute` now requires a new `ITreeInput` parameter to let executors check the input they can react to.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5628[#5628] [diagram] During layout of custom nodes, all the newly created nodes are now used and not only the first one.
The `INodeLayoutHandler` interface changes from `newlyAddedNode: Node<NodeData, DiagramNodeType> | undefined` to `newlyAddedNode: Node<NodeData, DiagramNodeType>[]`.
An example of usage is available in `EllipseNodeLayoutHandler.ts`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5823[#5823] Any locales contributed by downstream projects should take account the renamed keys
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5763[#5763] [diagram] `LabelLayoutData` record now has a Size parameter `record LabelLayoutData(String id, Position position, Size size)`, a migration participant has been added to migrate existing diagrams.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5071[#5071] [diagram] Custom node layout handlers must now set `minComputedWidth` and  `minComputedHeight` values to limit the resizer to a minimum size.
An example can be found with `EllipseNodeLayoutHandler.ts` and `EllipseNodeConverter.ts`.
If you want to use this limit on your custom nodes, you must either use the `SiriusWeb` `Resizer` component or add `minWidth={data.minComputedWidth ?? undefined}` and ` minHeight={data.minComputedHeight ?? undefined}` to the `ReactFlow` `NodeResize`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2884[#2884] [diagram] Tools for drag'n'dropping nodes on diagrams now support dropping multiple nodes.
As such, the variables `droppedNode` and `droppedElement` which are exposed in the body of such tools and which only supported a single node should stop being used and replaced with `droppedNodes` and `droppedElements` representing all the nodes (and corresponding semantic elements) dropped at once.
_Drop Node Tool_ definitions need to be adapted to handle these new variables.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5795[#5795] [diagram] `DraggableOutsideLabel` has been renamed to `DraggableResizableOutsideLabel` and its props changed.
`highlighted` has been decomposed into `selected` and  `hovered`.

This feature is opt-in: Sirius Web won't try to index models if it is not configured to do so.
You can check `doc/how-to/debug-elasticsearch-related-issues.adoc` to configure Sirius Web with Elasticsearch
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5743[#5743] [datatree] Add support for data trees.
A new module `sirius-components-datatree` has been created to:
* Define data trees in the backend
* Display data trees in the frontend (component `DataTree`)
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5731[#5731] [sirius-web] Add the omnibox on the projects browser
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/1028[#1028] [core] Add i18n support for frontend
The application language can be changed using the the `spring.mvc.locale` environment variable.
Sirius Web will maintain `en_EN` and `fr_FR` for the following namespaces: siriusComponentsCore, siriusComponentsDiagrams, siriusComponentsFormDescriptionEditors, siriusComponentsForms, siriusComponentsTrees, siriusComponentsValidation, siriusComponentsWidgetReference, and siriusWebApplication.
Downstream projects can provide new languages and new namespaces in `src/main/resources/i18n/{language}/{namespace}.json`.
Some part of each namespace may not be supported yet.
Do not hesitate to read the ADR-214 for further understanding.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5673[#5673] [sirius-web] The EditingContext expose a new method `Map<String, IViewConversionData> getViewConversionData()`
This can be used to retrieve a `ViewDiagramConversionData` that contains the mapping between view `IDiagramElementDescription` and programmatic `IDiagramElementDescription`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2809[#2809] [browser] Add support for overriding the tree description to use for a specific model browser.
In particular, this can be used to customize the tree used for the model browser of a particular reference widget by discriminating on the `descriptionId` parameter of the `modelBrowser://` id.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5200[#5200] [sirius-web] Add support for uploading projects with models referencing each other
Note that when some of the documents in the uploaded archive contain invalid references, only the subset of self-contained documents without invalid external references is imported.

* Create a new root object
* Download a document
* Create a new object
* Create a new representation
* Duplicate an object
* Duplicate a representation
As a result, some of those menu items are not contributed anymore on invalid use cases such as being able to create a new object in a read only library.

=== Deprecation warning


=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5334[#5334] [sirius-web] Fix the capability name to list librairies to `Library:list`.
The capability name `view` should be used when one element is requested.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5344[#5344] [diagram] The data structure `DiagramContext` is now immutable.
As a result, the methods `IDiagramContext#reset()` and `IDiagramContext#update(...)` have been removed.
The interface `IDiagramContext` is now deprecated and it will be removed soon.
All usage of `IDiagramContext` within Sirius Web have been replaced by `DiagramContext` for example in `IDiagramEventHandler#handle`.
The record `DiagramContext` is still implementing `IDiagramContext` for the moment and it still provides methods like `getDiagram()` or `getDiagramEvents()` but consumers of Sirius Web should switch to the new methods like `diagram()` or `diagramEvents()` as soon as possible.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5277[#5277] [sirius-web] Update the `ProjectSearchRepositoryDelegate` to include natures along with the returned projects for `#findAll(Before|After)`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5359[#5359] [sirius-web] The capability for the project settings images tab has change from `images` to `ProjectSettings#images`.
The GraphQL API still only require the ID of the contribution to the `projectSettingsTabExtensionPoint` extension point, but the data fetcher will add `ProjectSettings#` has prefix for the capability type.
Thus, any tab contributed by a downstream project will have as capability type `ProjectSettings#${tabId}`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4681[#4681] [view] The main Sirius Web JAR no longer includes EMF CodeGen dependencies,
including:
* `ecj-3.42.0.jar`
* `org.eclipse.core.commands-3.12.300.jar`
* `org.eclipse.core.variables-3.6.500.jar`
* `org.eclipse.debug.core-3.23.0.jar`
* `org.eclipse.emf.codegen-2.24.0.jar`
* `org.eclipse.emf.codegen.ecore-2.39.0.jar`
* `org.eclipse.jdt.core-3.42.0.jar`
* `org.eclipse.jdt.debug-3.23.0.jar`
* `org.eclipse.jdt.launching-3.23.300.jar`
* `org.eclipse.jdt.launching.macosx-3.6.300.jar`
* `org.eclipse.text-3.14.300.jar`
+
Downstream applications which had implicit dependencies to some of these may need to add new explicit dependencies.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4681[#4681] [diagram] The class `SelectionDialogTreeDescriptionBuilder;` was available in two different locations with exactly the same code, the version located in `org.eclipse.sirius.components.view.builder.generated.SelectionDialogTreeDescriptionBuilder` has been removed and only `org.eclipse.sirius.components.view.builder.generated.diagram.SelectionDialogTreeDescriptionBuilder` should be used.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5376[#5376] [sirius-web] An implementation of `IEditingContextDispatcher` and `IEventProcessorSubscriptionProvider` are now provided by default.
Downstream projects should stop provide their own implementations.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5376[#5376] [sirius-web] The _data-testid_ value for the project and library navigation bars have been renamed to `navbar-title`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5387[#5387] [sirius-web] Add support for read-only documents.
* `ResourceLoader#toResource` now requires an additional parameter `isReadOnly` specifying whether the loaded resource should be read-only
* `ResourceMetadataAdapter` has a new constructor `ResourceMetadataAdapter(String name, boolean isReadOnly)`, the constructor with only the `name` parameter still exists, and will set the `isReadOnly` attribute to `false`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5384[#5384] [sirius-web] Add support for uploading documents with read-only permission.
`UploadDocumentInput` now requires a mandatory `readOnly` boolean parameter.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5427[#5427] [diagram] An implementation of `ICustomNodeStyleDeserializer` is required to correctly upload a diagram  with custom nodes.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5433[#5433] [core] Replace the use of the attribute `kind` to compute the child creation descriptions by the container ID.
Instead of creating an EObject instance of the EClass in the EPackage previously provided by the attribute `kind` to compute child descriptors, use the `ObjectSearchService` with the container ID to retrieve that EObject.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5471[#5471] [diagram] `org.eclipse.sirius.components.diagrams.Label` is now a record
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5467[#5467] [diagram] To avoid edge blinking when refreshing the diagram, you need to set the property measured.height and measured.width with the value of the node layout data when converting a custom node accordingly to the xyflow https://reactflow.dev/learn/advanced-use/ssr-ssg-configuration#node-dimensions[documentation].
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5070[#5070] [diagram] The _boolean_ `isDraggedNode` has been added to `NodeData`.
This value must be initialized to _false_ in custom node converters like in `EllipseNodeConverter.ts`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5404[#5404] [diagram] The prop `isDisabled` of the `appearance widgets` has been renamed to `disabled` to match the name of the prop used by the underlying input.
* `element` of `PaletteAppearanceSectionContributionComponentProps` has been `removed`, you can use the hook https://reactflow.dev/api-reference/hooks/use-store-api[`useStoreApi`] or https://reactflow.dev/api-reference/hooks/use-react-flow[`useReactFlow`] from `XYFlow` in order to get the element.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5570[#5570] [tree] Tree items context menu entries now take an additional `selectTreeItems: (selectedTreeItemIds: string[]) => void` prop which must be used if the action's effect should modify the selection inside the tree (instead of or in staddition to the workbench selection).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5148[#5148] [core] Remove the parameters `EditingContextEventProcessor#REPRESENTATION_ID` and `EditingContextEventProcessor#REPRESENTATION_LABEL` which were supposed to be used as the key for some change description parameters in favor of a dedicated class holding those keys `ChangeDescriptionParameters`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5148[#5148] [core] Remove the change kind `ChangeKind#FOCUS_CHANGE` since it has not been used in months.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5632[#5632] [diagram] In order to handle undo on node appearance events you need to implement a `INodeAppearanceChangeUndoRecorder` the method `List<IAppearanceChange> computeUndoNodeAppearanceChanges(Node previousNode, Optional<INodeAppearanceChange> change)` is used to determine the list of `IAppearanceChange` that will be applied after an undo operation in order to get the previous style after a style change or if the node was deleted.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5512[#5512] [diagram] The nodes/edges selected inside a diagram no longer automatically follow the global workbench selection.
Instead, a new button available in the diagram's toolbar can be used to trigger a "one-shot" update the diagram's selection according to the current global selection.

* Existing documents will be migrated as follow: `is_read_only = TRUE` for library documents, `is_read_only = FALSE` for all the other documents.
* This information can be retrieved via `ResourceMetadataAdapter#isReadOnly()`.
* Read-only resources are only persisted the first time we see them, they are not persisted later on to ensure they are actually read-only, and potential modifications on them aren't stored.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5400[#5400] [sirius-web] Ensure that updating a library doesn't look for proxies in non-persisted resources.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5556[#5556] [sirius-web] In the onboard area, update `NewRepresentationArea`'s entries labels from displaying only the `defaultName` to displaying both the `defaultName` and the `diagramDescriptionName` to make it more clear which representation description will be used when creating a new representation.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5021[#5021] [diagram] When a tool asks for the selection of a given semantic element, at most one corresponding node/edge will be selected, even if the semantic element has multiple graphical elements associated to it.
The priority order to identify the graphical element to select in this case is: nodes before edges, parent (container) nodes before their children (sub-nodes and border nodes), and finally the order in which the node descriptions are defined in the diagram description.
When the user _explictly_ asks to synchronize the diagram's selection with the workbench (through the new diagram panel button) or from a another view (e.g. _Show in_ action from the Explorer), if a semantic element to select appears multiple times on a diagram, they are all selected unless their ancestors (direct or indirect parent/ancestor node) represents the same semantic element.
In other words, all top-level nodes corresponding to a semantic element to select are selected, but not their sub-nodes which target the same semantic element.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5545[#5545] [diagram] Reduce the size and opacity of the Minimap
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5148[#5148] [core] Add a new interface named `IChangeDescriptionListener` used to react to change descriptions sent within the `EditingContextEventProcessor`.
There should be only one instance of said interface in order to provide some orchestration for the various consumers of change descriptions.
We cannot rely on Spring ApplicationEventPublisher here so we need to manually provide some lifecycle steps for consumers.
As a result, another interface named `IChangeDescriptionConsumer` has been added for those who want to add some behavior once a change description is received by the editing context event processor.
Those consumers can trigger some behavior during one of three steps `preAccept`, `accept` or `postAccept`.
Default behaviors of Sirius Components and Sirius Web will be attached to those various steps.
For example, the disposal or deletion of outdated objects such as the representation event processors of deleted representations will be done in the `preAccept` step.
The refresh of all the representation event processors will be done in the `accept` phase.
The persistence of the editing context will be done in the `postAccept` phase.
This new low level API is quite new and may be changed heavily in the near future but it should provide a new way for downstream consumers of Sirius Web to hook their code in our lifecycle.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5285[#5285] [core] Extract additional concerns from the `EditingContextEventProcessor` thanks to the introduction of new services.
We have added the `IRepresentationEventProcessorProvider` in order to either retrieve an `IRepresentationEventProcessor` from the `IRepresentationEventProcessorRegistry` or create an initialize a new instance thanks to the `IRepresentationEventProcessorComposedFactory`.
We have also added the `IInputDispatcher` which is in charge of dispatching an input to its proper handler.

=== Deprecation warning

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5027[#5027] [core] In Sirius Web v2024.3.0, we introduced smaller core services and indicated that `IObjectService` may be deprecated in the future.
You can now consider that it is deprecated and will be removed soon.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5114[#5114] [sirius-web] The properties `targetObjectKind` and `targetObjectLabel` will soon be removed from the various representations were they have been used.
Those are some remnants of some previous technical debt from the management of the selection on the frontend.
We have improved the management of the selection to remove this issue so now we can clean those remaining parts.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5141[#5141] [core] `getRepresentationEventProcessors` from `IEditingContextEventProcessor` will be removed.
Add IRepresentationEventProcessorRegistry, it can be use to retrieve any `RepresentationEventProcessor`


=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5027[#5027] [core] Specific concerns from the Sirius Web explorer have been removed from core services, as such the following methods have been removed:
* `ILabelService#getFullLabel`
* `ILabelService#getLabelField`
* `ILabelService#isLabelEditable`
* `ILabelServiceDelegate#getFullLabel`
* `ILabelServiceDelegate#getLabelField`
* `ILabelServiceDelegate#isLabelEditable`
* `IDefaultLabelService#getFullLabel`
* `IDefaultLabelService#getLabelField`
* `IDefaultLabelService#isLabelEditable`
* `IEditService#editLabel`
* `IEditServiceDelegate#editLabel`
* `IDefaultEditService#editLabel`
* `IObjectService#getFullLabel`
* `IObjectService#getLabelField`
* `IObjectService#isLabelEditable`
* `IEditService#editLabel`
* `IEditServiceDelegate#editLabel`
* `IDefaultEditService#editLabel`
The method `ILabelService#getImagePath` has also been renamed `ILabelService#getImagePaths` given that it returns a list of image paths.
It has also been removed from `IObjectService`.
The multiple methods available to compute a label (`ILabelService#getFullLabel`, `ILabelService#getLabel` and `ILabelService#getStyledLabel`) have thus been replaced with only `ILabelService#getStyledLabel` remaining.
It will encourage the adoption of `StyledString` in various parts of the application and will provide one and only one entry point for specifiers who need to change the label of an object.
For those who want to build a representation tightly coupled with the behavior of the Sirius Web explorer with regard to labels, new services have been introduced:
* `o.e.s.w.application.views.explorer.services.api.IExplorerLabelService`
* `o.e.s.w.application.views.explorer.services.api.IDefaultExplorerLabelService`
* `o.e.s.w.application.views.explorer.services.api.IExplorerLabelServiceDelegate`
Those services will replace the management of label which was tightly coupled with other concerns of the explorer in `IExplorerServices`.
The following methods have also been removed:
* `IExplorerServices#isEditable` which is replaced with `IExplorerLabelService#isEditable`
* `IExplorerServices#getLabel` which is replaced with `ILabelService#getStyledLabel`
The edition of the label of the explorer, which was previously done thanks to `IEditService#editLabel` is now performed thanks to `IExplorerLabelService#editLabel`.
Specifiers who are relying on EMF based objects can customize the behavior of this specific part by implementing an instance of `IEMFLabelServiceDelegate`.
This new API reduce the amount of code that needs to be written to change the label of EMF based objects in the explorer and other views (query, related elements, details, etc).
Using the `IStyledStringConverter`, one can add support for EMF `IItemStyledLabelProvider` fairly easily.
This support is not active by default for all metamodels because EMF uses both the name of the EClass and the value of the label feature by default.
The name of the EClass being a bit redundant it was decided a long time ago in Sirius Web not to display it (this is the behavior of `DefaultEMFLabelService`).
If your EMF based objects do not have a feature that can be used as a label, consider providing an `IEMFLabelServiceDelegate` to compute a proper label.
This type of customization was not possible previously.
Additional concerns will be removed in the future from `IObjectService` until we can remove this class entirely.
- The backend modules `sirius-components-graphiql` and `sirius-components-graphql-voyager` and the frontend module `sirius-components-specification-layout` have been removed.
They were unused and out of date.
- [table] Remove the useless parameters `ITableIdProvider` and `IObjectService` in `ICustomCellConverter#convert` since both can be retrieved by the Spring dependency injection for implementations of this interface which need them
- [core] Move read only related services located in `sirius-web-application` to `sirius-components-core`.
As a result, `org.eclipse.sirius.components.core.api.IReadOnlyObjectPredicate` can now be used by Sirius Components modules and `org.eclipse.sirius.components.core.api.IReadOnlyObjectPredicateDelegate` can be implemented by downstream consumers of Sirius Components.
- [core] Move default implementation of core services in `sirius-web-application`.
Previously those implementation were located in various modules such as `sirius-components-emf`.
Now all the default assumptions on the way Sirius Web works are consolidated in `org.eclipse.sirius.web.application.object.services`.
In this package, you can now find the following default implementations:
* `DefaultContentService`
* `DefaultEditService`
* `DefaultIdentityService`
* `DefaultLabelService`
* `DefaultObjectSearchService`
* `DefaultReadOnlyObjectPredicate`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/422[#422] [diagram] The `idProvider` has been removed from `InsideLabelDescription`, `OutsideLabelDescription` and `LabelDescription`.
`LabelIdProvider` is now used to calculate a label's id.
Note that the `OWNER_ID` variable has also been removed.
- [test] Subscription runners used in the tests are now returning a flux of payloads instead of the flux of data fetcher results.
As a result, the difference in behavior between the tests subscribing to existing representations and those which started by the creation of a new representation has been removed.
As a result, most instances of `flux.filter(DataFetcherResult.class::isInstance).map(DataFetcherResult.class::cast).map(DataFetcherResult::getData)` can be removed.
Utility classes to help create assertions on those flux have been introduced to write tests more easily such as `DiagramEventPayloadConsumer`, `FormEventPayloadConsumer` or `TreeEventPayloadConsumer` among others.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5152[#5152] [emf] Update the following methods in `IMigrationParticipant`, by adding a new `JsonResource` parameter:
* `void postObjectLoading(JsonResource resource, EObject eObject, JsonObject jsonObject)`
* `Object getValue(JsonResource resource, EObject eObject, EStructuralFeature feature, Object value)`
* `String getEObjectUri(JsonResource resource, EObject eObject, EReference eReference, String uri)`
Those changes reflect the update of `IJsonResourceProcessor` in EMF-JSON 2.5.3.
See https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-emf-json/blob/master/CHANGELOG.adoc#v253[the Sirius EMF JSON changelog] for details.
- [sirius-web] Update the signature of the representation migration participants to provide the editing context.
* Add new `IEditingContext` parameter in the method `IRepresentationMigrationParticipant#replaceJsonNode`
* Add new `IEditingContext` parameter in the method `IRepresentationContentMigrationService#getMigratedContent`
* Add new `IEditingContext` parameter in the constructor `RepresentationMigrationService`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5039[#5039] [diagram] The impact analysis dialog is not in charge of retrieving the impact analysis report anymore, and has been moved to `sirius-components-core`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5118[#5118] [tree] `SingleClickTreeItemContextMenuEntry` has a new field `withImpactAnalysis` that needs to be filled by the backend.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5126[#5126] [core] The decision to display the frontend card to create a blank project, upload a project, and browse all template is now made by the backend.
These cards are not contributed to the `createProjectAreaCardExtensionPoint` extension point anymore.
They will be displayed if a project template with one of the following specific ID is returned: `create-project`, `upload-project`, or `browse-all-project-templates`.
Thus, downstream projects that would want to hide these cards, will not be able to do it by not contributing them to the `createProjectAreaCardExtensionPoint` extension point, but by providing a `ICapabilityVoter`.
Another consequence is that the `projectTemplates` graphql query now requires the `context` parameter.
A new "demo" profile is now available to start Sirius Web as a demo instance.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5185[#5185] [sirius-web] The two project download buttons have been removed from their extension point contribution `projectContextMenuEntryExtensionPoint` and `ProjectDownloadMenuItemExtension` to become a standard button.
They were contributed by extension points in order to let downstream projects disable them using a custom `ExtensionRegistryMergeStrategy`.
Downstream projects are now able to disable the project download frontend support by contributing a `ICapabilityVoter` that disables the `download` capability on project.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5126[#5126] [core] Remove `readonly` props from `EditProjectNavbar` since this props was only used to enable or disable the project rename button.
This purpose can be achieved with the `rename` capabilities.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5126[#5126] [sirius-web] Remove the `editProjectViewReadOnlyPredicateExtensionPoint` that was use to define whether the edit project view should be read-only or not.
This purpose can be achieve with the `edit` project capabilities by contributing a `ICapabilityVoter`:
[source,java]
----
@Service
public class CanEditProjectCapabilityVoter implements ICapabilityVoter {

  public CapabilityVote vote(String type, String identifier, String capability) {
    if ("Project".equals(type) && "edit".equals(capability) && identifier != null) {
      if (projectCanBeEdited(identifier)) {
        return CapabilityVote.GRANTED;
      }
    }

    return CapabilityVote.DENIED;
  }

}
----
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5181[#5181] [sirius-web] Remove the contribution that contribute the link to libraries to the `navigationBarMenuEntryExtensionPoint` extension point.
The link to libraries has become a standard menu item which can be hidden providing a `ICapabilityVoter` with the type `Library` and the capability `view`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5212[#5212] [diagram] Custom nodes should use `useConnectionLineNodeStyle` in order to get the correct style feedback when creating a connection near the border of a node, this can be use like `connectionFeedbackStyle or dropFeedbackStyle`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4886[#4886] [core] In the frontend, `WorkbenchViewContribution` now need to have an ID. This ID is used to share the workbench state through shareable URLs.

If the connection line is hovering the middle of a node, then the handle is placed automatically using the layout algorithm.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/5202[#5202] [sirius-web] Add support for project settings tab capabilities.
Make the project image settings view contribution rely on the project tab capabilities.
The extension point contribution ID is used as the _type_ for the `ICapabilityVoter#vote`

[source,java]
----
public class ImageProjectSettingsTabCapabilityVoter implements ICapabilityVoter {

    public CapabilityVote vote(String type, String identifier, String capability) {
        // We are testing the type with "images" because it is the ID of the frontend contribution to the `projectSettingsTabExtensionPoint` extension point.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4886[#4886] [core] Add an action, when editing a project, in the project contextual menu, to create a shareable URL.
+ This URL includes the current workbench selection and the current workbench state.
+ For now the only workbench state that is shareable is: the active views on the left and right panels.
+ Reversely, upon resolving a URL specifying a workbench state, that state is used to set up the initial state of the workbench components.

As a result, it is now possible to re-enter the thread of the editing context event processor to ask for additional information in the body of a GraphQL subscription.
While very small, this change is being made in a very important part of the code.
In case of issue with this change, it may have a performance impact and also be the cause of some regressions.

In `ProjectSettingsView`, we will now rely on the `tabId` from the URL to identify the setting tab that should be opened, and update the URL whenever the selected tab changes.
The page will now redirect to a 404 if the `tabId` in the URL is not a known tab.

=== Deprecation warning



=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4858[#4858] [view] The API used to provide custom form widgets for the view DLS has been updated to use a service based approach instead of an EMF based switch.
Implementations of the interface `org.eclipse.sirius.components.view.emf.form.IWidgetConverterProvider` should now switch to `org.eclipse.sirius.components.view.emf.form.converters.widgets.api.IWidgetDescriptionConverter`.
During this refactoring some concepts have been moved and their package have been updated such as `IFormIdProvider`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4893[#4893] [compatibility] The support for odesign files from Sirius Desktop has been removed now that the support for the View DSL provides all the features that were supported in the odesign part.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4909[#4909] [sirius-web] The class `CreateForkedStudioMutationRuner` as been moved in `sirius-web-tests` and renamed to `CreateForkedStudioMutationRunner` to let downstream applications use it.
- Sirius Web now uses Sirius EMF JSON 2.5.0, which includes breaking changes (and much improved performance).
Of particular note: projects which create View-based, in-memory, representation description programatically and rely on `EcoreUtil.getURI()` to derive a stable object id should either:
* Make sure they invoke `EcoreUtil.getURI()` *before* their objects are moved inside a `JsonResourceImpl` (see https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/master/packages/sirius-web/backend/sirius-web-papaya/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/papaya/services/PapayaViewProvider.java[`PapayaViewProvider`] for an example).
* Create the JSON resource they use for their View models with the new option `JsonResource.OPTION_FORCE_DEFAULT_REFERENCE_SERIALIZATION` set:
+
[source,java]
----
Map<String, Object> customOptions = Map.of(JsonResource.OPTION_FORCE_DEFAULT_REFERENCE_SERIALIZATION, Boolean.TRUE);
JsonResource resource = jsonResourceFactory.createResource(uri, this.customOptions);
----
+
See https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-emf-json/blob/master/CHANGELOG.adoc#v250[the Sirius EMF JSON changelog] for details.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4931[#4931] [sirius-web] Add a new `updateTargetObjectId` method to `IRepresentationMetadataUpdateService`.
Every implementation of `IRepresentationMetadataUpdateService` should add its own implementation of `updateTargetObjectId`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4933[#4933] [emf] Add the ability to know all the migration participants executed on a given resource through `ResourceMetadataAdapter`
* `MigrationData getMigrationData()` method has been renamed to `MigrationData getLastMigrationData()`.
* `void setMigrationData()` method has been renamed/changed to `boolean addMigrationData()`.
* A new method `List<MigrationData> getAllMigrationData()` method has been added.
* https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4102[#4102] [sirius-web] The `hasChildren()` and `getDefaultChildren()` of the [`IExplorerServices`](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/blob/master/packages/sirius-web/backend/sirius-web-application/src/main/java/org/eclipse/sirius/web/application/views/explorer/services/api/IExplorerServices.java) interface now expect an additional `List<RepresentationMetadata> existingRepresentations` argument with the list of all the representations to consider when rendering explorer items.
In the default implementation (in `ExplorerChildrenProvider`) its value comes from the new variable `existingRepresentations` injected by `ExplorerRenderVariablesCustomizer`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4968[#4968] [diagram] The `Delete from diagram` tool is no longer automatically added to the palette from a node with an unsynchronized
layout.
It is up to the specifier whether to create a tool to perform this action.
Note that a migration participant adds this tool for existing diagram descriptions.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4874[#4874] [diagram] `childrenLayoutStrategy` feature has been moved from `NodeDescription` to `NodeStyleDescription`.
All custom node style descriptions must be regenerated to add the new `childrenLayoutStrategy` feature from `NodeStyleDescription`.
- All the `ParametricSVG` related code has been removed.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4373[#4373] [trees] `onExpand` and `onExpandAll` is removed from `Tree` and all the tree components props.
It is now possible to expand a tree item by using `onExpandedElementChange`.
The "expand all" contextual menu entry (and its implementation) has been moved to Sirius Web as a contribution.


=== Dependency update

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4820[#4820] [releng] Switch to EMFJson 2.4.1.

=== New Features

- [releng] The integration tests from the main `sirius-web` module are now exported in a https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-jar-plugin/examples/create-test-jar.html[test JAR].
Downstream projects can get access to them in their own test code by adding the following dependency:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.sirius</groupId>
  <artifactId>sirius-web</artifactId>
  <classifier>tests</classifier>
  <type>test-jar</type>
  <version>${sirius-web.version}</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4887[#4887] [diagram] Allow to override the default behavior of node actions.
The `diagramNodeActionOverrideContributionExtensionPoint` extension point can be used to contribute components to use when a node action is available
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4940[#4940] [diagram] Add the ability to open the image viewer for a diagram using the SVG support instead of the PNG one.
For that, one should simply use the parameter `mode=svg-viewer`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4941[#4941] [diagram] Add the ability to perform an arrange all before displaying the diagram in the image viewer.
For that, one should use the parameter `arrangeAll=true`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4918[#4918] [diagram] Add a node action to manage visibility of children
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4102[#4102] [sirius-web] A new interface, `IRepresentationRenderVariableCustomizer`, can now be used to customize the set of variables available when rendering a Tree.
In particular it can be used to add new variables which are costly to compute so that they can be set *once* per tree render, and then used from any expression in the tree definition.
This mechanism is currently provisional and only available for `TreeDescription` but will probably be generalized (maybe in an updated form) for other representations in the future.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4927[#4927] [diagram] Add `IManageVisibilityMenuActionsHandler` and `IManageVisibilityMenuActionsProvider` to add menu items to the manage visibility modal
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4968[#4968] [diagram] Remove auto-generated tool `Delete from diagram` for unsynchronized nodes to let specifiers provide one with their desired behavior
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4756[#4756] [diagram] Add first implementation of customized appearance on rectangular nodes


=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4308[#4308] [diagram] Handles now take bending points into account
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4826[#4826] [diagram] Allow source and target handle position changes during edge customization
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4830[#4830] [view] Add `Edge Width` property in `edgeStyle` details view
- [sirius-web] Avoid a database access if not necessary.
Refactor the test to leverage boolean expression shortcut and avoid an unnecessary call to this.semanticDataSearchService.findById() if we already know we are inside a studio or a papaya project.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4827[#4827] [diagram] Add default quick access tool for deletable and editable edges
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4098[#4098] [interpreter] Cache the AQL services for a given `EPackage`.
This improves the time needed to open a project and other scenarios where we create new AQL interpreters.
The improvement on project opening will be proportional to the size/complexity of the metamodels and the number of View-based representations available in the project.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4858[#4858] [view] Switch to a service based approach to convert forms
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4835[#4835] [view] Order Node/Edge palette's tools/tools sections the same way.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4861[#4861] [diagram] Keep the specified target position of the handle when creating an edge
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4877[#4877] [diagram] Change handle position after dragging first/last segment on node borders
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4879[#4879] [diagram] Prevents an edge segment from being parallel to node borders
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4867[#4867] [diagram] When creating a new connection, use the parent as candidate if possible
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4840[#4850] [sirius-web] Reduce the amount of data fetched from the DB on project opening.
`StudioCapableEditingContextPredicate` (called several times on projet open) now avoids fetching the documents content, which it does not need.
On large projects this can significantly reduce the amount of data fetched from the DB and not actually used.
- [sirius-web] The switch to Sirius EMF JSON 2.5.0 should greatly improve the performance of loading and saving semantic data.
This is mostly visible when cold-opening projects with large documents (load performance), and when saving semantic data after edition operations.
Note that the improvements will only be visible for projects created or modified after the update; existing semantic data which has not been modified will continue to be "slow" to load/read until it is modified at least once and saved in the new, improved format.
- [releng] Switch to Sirius EMF JSON 2.5.1 and thus add the ability for a migration participant to change the URI used by a proxy during a migration.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4866[#4866] [diagram] Disable the last executed tool when opening the palette, if it is not available in the current state, it is still displayed for information.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4099[#4099] [sirius-web] Create the bytes array for the original contents only once
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4099[#4099] [sirius-web] Move proxy validation into `DocumentSanitizedJsonContentProvider`.
We need the actual Resource to perform the validation, so do this inside `DocumentSanitizedJsonContentProvider` so that we can cleanup after ourself and remove the resource used to obtain the initial JSON content from the resource set.
This is a first step to ensure that we do not have unintended side-effects on the ResourceSet used, so that later on we can perform all the upload-related operations inside the already existing EditingContext's ResourceSet and avoid creating a new only (at great cost).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4099[#4099] [sirius-web] Cleanup temporary resources in `DocumentSanitizedJsonContentProvider`.
This has a non-trivial cost for medium to large models as removing the resources triggers `oes.components.emf.services.EditingContextCrossReferenceAdapter.clearReferencesTo(EObject)`, which can be quite costly. But it is required to avoid unintended side-effects if we want to be able to perform the whole upload operation directly inside the already active EditingContext's ResourceSet.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4099[#4099] [sirius-web] Consider only non-derived refrences when testing for proxies.
In the case of UML for example, which includes *many* derived references, this can have a significant impact.
It is safe to only look for proxies in "plain" (non-derived) references: if none is found there, there is no (sane) way for a derived reference to produce one.
In all strictness, it *is* possible for the Java code inside a derived reference to produce a proxy object, but that is highly non-standard behavior, and given the performance benefit of ignoring these references it seems a good default.
If we really want to support "pathological" metamodels maybe we could introduce some flags and/or other mechanism as a possible but non-default behavior.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4099[#4099] [sirius-web] Use low-level code for performance-critical ProxyValidator
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4099[#4099] [sirius-web] Upload new models directly into the existing ResourceSet.
This can be disabled with a system property for easy testing/comparison and if some applications decide that it is too risky in their context and accept the additional cost of re-creating a whole temporary editing context for the upload operation.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4875[#4875] [table] Improve table representation lifecycle
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4825[#4825] [table] Add support for tooltip on table cells
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4332[#4332] [table] Remove table dependency in `sirius-components-form`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4931[#4931] [sirius-web] Add the ability to change programmatically the object to which a representation is attached.
For that the service `IRepresentationMetadataUpdateService` has a new method named `updateTargetObjectId`.
By itself, it will not be enough, one would also have to update the content of the representation too but `IRepresentationContentUpdateService` already support that.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4933[#4933] [emf] Add the ability to know all the migration participants executed on a given resource through `ResourceMetadataAdapter`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4932[#4932] [core] Add a pre/post processor mechanism to `EditingContextEventProcessorRegistry`.
Thanks to this mechanism one can trigger some behavior after the entire loading of the editing context and before the creation of the `IEditingContextEventProcessor` or just after the creation of the `IEditingContextEventProcessor`.

The onboard area can now display all the representations created in the project and it is not limited to the first 20 representations.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4963[#4963] [core] Avoid change recording overhead for some well-known read-only operations.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4102[#4102] [sirius-web] Rendering the contents of the _Explorer_ now uses much less accesses to the database, for faster results.
The number of database queries used is now independent on the number of items to render.
This is done thanks to the addition of a fast-path in `ExplorerServices#getTreeItemObject`.
This avoids one DB query per tree item in most cases where the `IDefaultObjectSearchService` knows how to find the element.
This changes the behavior if there are delegates which *override* the default response from `IDefaultObjectSearchService` instead of simply adding support for elements not handled at all by `IDefaultObjectSearchService`.

Handle the recursive part of the tree rendering in `Tree` instead of `TreeItem`, so that re-rendering a particular `TreeItem` has a fixed cost, independent of how many of its descendants are expanded/visible.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4373[#4373] [trees] Allow backend definition of ExpandAll tool in the explorer
Specifiers can now create `CustomTreeItemContextMenuEntry` instances in the view DSL to indicate to use a frontend component as contextual menu entry.
The _ExpandAll_ tool is now a Sirius Web contribution that can be enabled via this mechanism.

=== Deprecation warning

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4613[#4613] [sirius-web] The service `IExplorerServices` which has been used as a collection of everything needed by the Sirius Web explorer has too many responsibilities and some additional responsibilities would need to be accumulated in this concept in the near future.
As a result, those responsibilities will be entangled and separated in smaller dedicated services.


=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4609[#4609] [sirius-web] The field `RepresentationMetadata#project: AggregateReference<Project, String>` has been removed and replaced by `RepresentationMetadata#semanticData: AggregateReference<SemanticData, UUID>`
- [releng] Sirius Web now requires on PostgreSQL v15 or later.
Version 12 which was documented/recommended in our README and used for the frontend e2e tests on the CI is EOL since last November (see https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).
Our backend integration tests actual use the `postgres:latest` image (see `AbstractIntegrationTests`), v15 is somewhat arbitrary middle ground of a still maintained version to test against for the e2e tests while not being the "bleeding edge".
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4641[#4641] [table] Table widget is now a custom widget contribute to form.
You have to add `tableWidgetDocumentTransform` to your extensionRegistry to use it.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4635[#4635] [sirius-web] Since the switch from using the `Project#id` as the `editingContextId` to the use of the `SemanticData#id` instead, `IProjectEditingContextApplicationService` could have been used as a service to switch from the `Project#id` to the `editingContextId`.
Given that it is an application service, it comes with some constraints with regard to transactions, for that a new reusable service named `IProjectEditingContextService` has now been added to manipulate the `projectId` and `editingContextId` instead.
`IProjectEditingContextApplicationService` has thus been modified to be more focused on its original goal as the behavior of the `Project#currentEditingContext` datafetcher.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4443[#4443] [table] `ICell` has a new method `getDescriptionId` that all implementors should provide.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4577[#4577] [diagram] Remove `payload` and `refreshEventPayloadId` from `DiagramContext` since they are not used anymore
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4518[#4518] [sirius-web] Allow createCommit REST API to amend commit.
`IProjectDataVersioningRestService#createCommit` has a new `List<RestDataVersion> changes` parameter.
`IDefaultProjectDataVersioningRestService#createCommit` has a new `List<RestDataVersion> changes` parameter.
`IProjectDataVersioningRestServiceDelegate#createCommit` has a new `List<RestDataVersion> changes` parameter.
`RestDataVersionPayloadSerializer` has been deleted.
There is no more need for a specific serializer for this `RestDataVersion#payload` attribute, because `RestDataVersion#payload` is now typed with a `Map<String, Object>` instead of `Object`.
The `Map<String, Object>` is handled by the default serializer/deserializer.
`RestDataVersionRequest#payload` is now typed by a `Map<String, Object>` instead of `IRestDataRequest`.
The `Map<String, Object>` is handled by the default serializer/deserializer.
- [releng] We now use Sirius EMF JSON 2.4.0 (from 2.3.2 before), which changed its Maven `groupId` from `org.eclipse.sirius.emfjson` to `org.eclipse.sirius` to match all other Maven artifacts produced in Eclipse Sirius.
The new GAV is `org.eclipse.sirius:org.eclipse.sirius.emfjson:2.4.0-SNAPSHOT`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4679[#4679] [tree] `TreeView` no longer handles selection.
The parent component is now responsible for this.
With this change, the type of the data transfer provided when a tree item is dragged and dropped has changed from `{id: string, kind: string}[]` to `string[]`.
It now only contains the identifier of the tree item.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4464[#4464] [core] After months of work since the removal of `SelectionEntry#label`, we have now successfully removed `SelectionEntry#kind`.
Both properties were added to `SelectionEntry` years ago due to a leak in an abstraction used by the explorer.
In the near future, we will start cleaning up the rest of the code by removing properties like `targetObjectKind` and `targetObjectLabel` which are now unnecessary.
We will also remove `GQLTreeItem#kind` later.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4700[#4700] [view] The following attributes of `EdgeDescription` have been renamed : `sourceNodesDescriptions to sourceDescriptions`, `targetNodeDescriptions to targetDescriptions`, `sourceNodeExpression to sourceExpression` and `targetNodesExpression to targetExpression`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4714[#4174] [sirius-web] Default routes are contributed thanks to the router extension point.
Downstream projects contributing their own route will have to use a `ExtensionRegistryMergeStrategy` to either merge their contribution to the sirius-web one, or to add sirius-web routes to their own contribution.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4706[#4706] [diagram] The following attributes of `org.eclipse.sirius.components.diagrams.description.EdgeDescription` have been renamed : `sourceNodeDescriptions to sourceDescriptions`, `targetNodeDescriptions to targetDescriptions`, `sourceNodesProvider to sourceProvider` and `targetNodesProvider to targetProvider`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4727[#4727] [domain] [sirius-web] a new parameter has been added to `Viewer#getProjects` in the graphql API, and thus, the `IProjectApplicationService` and the `IProjectSearchService` API have been updated accordingly.
+ Queries of `ProjectSearchRepositoryDelegate` has been updated so any downstream project providing their own `IProjectSearchRepositoryDelegate` may have to change on their queries if they want the filter on project to work.
- [tree] The type `TreeItemContextMenuEntry` which was exported by `sirius-components-trees` has been replaced with the raw GraphQL type `GQLTreeItemContextMenuEntry`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4750[#4750] [view] Classes used to evaluate model operations based on the EMF Switch pattern such as `OperationInterpreter`, `OperationInterpreterViewSwitch`, `DiagramOperationInterpreter` and `DiagramOperationInterpreterViewSwitch` have been removed in favor of a service based approach used in most of our code.
The use of these classes can be replaced by the new Spring service `IOperationExecutor`.
This new approach offer a better API with an explicit status as a result (instead of an `Optional<VariableManager>`).
It also offers some additional customization capabilities for those who may want to change the behavior of the evaluation of the model operations.
On top of that, the API of `IWidgetConverterProvider` has been simplified and useless dependencies have been removed.
Given that implementations of this interface should be Spring services, they can retrieve their relevant dependencies by themselves.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4707[#4707] [diagram] The function `convertHandles = (gqlNode: GQLNode<GQLNodeStyle>, gqlEdges: GQLEdge[], handleLayoutData: GQLHandleLayoutData[]): ConnectionHandle[] ` is now `convertHandles = (elementId: string, gqlEdges: GQLEdge[], handleLayoutData: GQLHandleLayoutData[] ): ConnectionHandle[]`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4744[#4744] [diagram] `SingleClickOnTwoDiagramElementsCandidate` `sources and targets` variables are now of type `IDiagramElementDescription`
- [view] The variable `nodeDescription` available in edge tools has been renamed to `diagramElementDescription` and will be soon removed.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4745[#4745] [table] Add table cell extension point.
To illustrate this new extension point, it has been decided that the checkbox cell widget would become such an extension.
This means that all checkbox cell classes have been moved into sirius-web-application module:
* CheckboxCell
* CheckboxCellComponent
* CheckboxCellComponentProps
* CheckboxCellDescription
* CheckboxCellElementProps
* EditCheckboxCellInput
They are now in `org.eclipse.sirius.web.application.views.table.customcells` package.

=== New Features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4588[#4588] [core] Added support for custom ordering in representation creation modal.
See the new interface `org.eclipse.sirius.components.emf.services.api.IRepresentationDescriptionMetadataSorter`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4616[#4616] [sirius-web] Allow end users to see the content of a library in a workbench, the path of the new page is `/libraries/:namespace/:name/:version`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4597[#4597] [sirius-web] Add a command to publish libraries from studios
The command creates a library for each _RepresentationDescription_ and _Domain_ in the studio, and creates the dependencies between them.
A _shared components_ library can be created in the process to store elements that are needed by other libraries but are not stored in libraries themselves.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4664[#4664] [diagram] Make ConnectionLine snap to the border of a node
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4652[#4652] [sirius-web] Add support for loading semantic data with their dependencies
Semantic data can have dependencies between them, which are transitively loaded when an editing context is loaded.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4668[#4668] [sirius-web] Ensure that the resources loaded from libraries are identified as read only.
For that a new predicate `IReadOnlyObjectPredicate` has been added to figure out if objects are read only.
A default implementation has been provided to return `true` if the object belongs to the semantic data of a library.
This predicate is used in Sirius Web's explorer to prevent users from deleting or renaming elements from libraries.
This API is provisional for the moment and it may be moved or changed while improving the support for libraries.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4509[#4509] [sirius-web] Add a command to import libraries into a studio
The command is only present in studio projects, but the corresponding mutation can work on any project.
Downstream applications can provide their own command to import libraries into their projects, and rely on Sirius Web's import mechanism to load libraries.
The publication of a studio that references elements from imported libraries now produces libraries with the appropriate dependencies.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3740[#3740] [sirius-web] Add support for object duplication from explorer
+
image:doc/screenshots/duplicationDialog.png[DuplicationDialog, 70%]
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4383[#4383] [sirius-web] Add support for representation duplication from explorer
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4700[#4700] [view] It is now possible to set an edge as the source or target of an edge in the view dsl, following work will allow the actual rendering on the back-end and front-end.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4493[#4493] [sirius-web] Add an user indicator when a representation is loading
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2807[#2807] [diagram] Add another experimental version of the SVG export.
+ Made in two steps, first it does the svg export of `html-to-image`, then use the result to create our own version.
+ We made this choice to rapidly solve the different css transform that `html-to-image` does for us.
+ It requires that downstream projects contributing custom nodes add the `data-svg="${rect|image|svg|text|defs}"` attribute on each dom element that will represent a part of the node in svg.
+ If any of the default value match the need, it is possible to contribute a `IElementSVGExportHandler` thanks to the `svgExportIElementSVGExportHandlerExtensionPoint` extension point.
+ The value of `data-svg` attribute should match the value from the contributed `IElementSVGExportHandler#canHandle`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4694[#4694] [sirius-web] Add a contextual menu action to update imported libraries
The action is visible on libraries that are first-level dependencies of the project (it is not visible on transitive dependencies).
Update operations producing dependencies to different versions of the same library are handled by the `EditingContextDependencyLoader`, which loads one of the versions and do not load the other ones.
The existing update implementation assumes that the identifiers of documents contained in libraries are stable across versions of the library.
The implementation of the library update mechanism is generic and works on any project containing EMF resources.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4375[#4375] [diagram] Add support for a first version of impact analysis before tool execution.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4706[#4706] [diagram] The back-end now render edges that have for source or target another edge (only if this edge have for source or target a node), an edge won't be rendered if both his source and target are another edge.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4483[#4483] Add row level filters in table
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4727[#4727] [sirius-web] Add the support for projects filter.
+ One can add a map of filter operation to the `useProjects` hook.
+ Add the `useProjectsProjectFilterExtensionPoint` to contribute filter that will always be given to the `getProjects` query.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4669[#4669] [diagram] Allow manual positioning of edge's handles by reconnecting an edge on the same node
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4720[#4720] [diagrams] It is now possible to declare actions on diagram node descriptions in the View DSL.
An action is composed with a label, an icon, a precondition and a body.
The body contains the operations available in the View DSL as they already exists for the tools for example.
Actions are visible on nodes on diagrams, on the top right corner of the nodes, and represented by their icon set in the Action declaration in the View DSL.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4707[#4707] [diagram] Enable frontend rendering of edges that have another edge as source or target.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4710[#4710] [table] Add support for sorting tables
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4744[#4744] [diagram] Allow execution of SingleClickOnTwoDiagramElements with edge as target
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4748[#4748] [diagram] Allow execution of SingleClickOnTwoDiagramElements with edge as source

Except for the specific case where `cause === 'refresh'` in `DiagramRenderer` (which corresponds to a layout update *after* an existing operation which caused the refresh, in which case we must reuse the original event id), other diagram-related mutations should behave like all the others and get a unique event id to clearly identify them.

=== Deprecation warning


=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4416[#4416] [sirius-web] Tests written for Sirius Web should now leverage the brand new annotation `@GivenSiriusWebServer` which will set up all the test data of the server.
It will allow us to create more complex test data shared by all integration tests to detect additional problems.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4416[#4416] [sirius-web] The `IEditingContextMigrationParticipantPredicate` will now use the id of the editing context instead of the whole editing context in order to find out if the migration participant should be activated.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4418[#4418] [sirius-web] Change type of project_id from UUID to String
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4404[#4404] [sirius-web] The extension point `navigationBarIconExtensionPoint` has been updated to accept an arbitrary React Component.
Downstream applications which were using it to change the image of the home button will now be in charge of rendering the whole button.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4362[#4362] [sirius-web] The `editProjectNavbarSubtitleExtensionPoint` has been removed.
Use the new frontend extension point `navigationBarCenterContributionExtensionPoint`, which is strictly more powerful, instead.
See `PapayaExtensionRegistry.tsx` for an example of how rendering a project subtitle can be achieved with the new extension point.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4408[#4408] [diagram] Display diagram contextual menu (a.k.a the Palette) with right click instead of left click.
It is not an API breaking change but a breaking change from the end-user point of view.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4500[#4500] [sirius-web] Remove the tight coupling between `SemanticData` and `Project` by removing `SemanticData#project` along with the column `project_id` from the `semantic_data` table
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4501[#4501] [browser] `IReferenceWidgetRootCandidateSearchProvider` API has been renamed to `IModelBrowserRootCandidateSearchProvider` and moved to the `sirius-components-collaborative-browser` module.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4377[#4377] [sirius-web] The `sirius-web-table` project has been renamed to `sirius-web-view-fork`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4372[#4372] [sirius-web] The identifier used for `editingContextId` is now `SemanticData#id` instead of `Project#id`.
In order to find the `editingContextId` from the `projectId` one should leverage `IProjectSemanticDataSearchService#findByProjectId` and use the `ìd` of the semantic data found.
To find instead the `projectId` from the `editingContextId`, `IProjectSemanticDataSearchService#findBySemanticDataId` should be used along with the `id` of the project.
The method `IEditingContextLoader#load` has also been updated to not use `projectId` as parameter anymore but instead the `SemanticData` directly.

=== Dependency update

- [releng] Upgrade `turbo` to version 2.3.3 (from 1.13.3 before).
The `start` task used in our turbo configuration is now marked as `persistent` and as a result we have separated the `start` script from `sirius-web` used to run the frontend in dev from from the `start` script from other packages used to build them in development mode by renaming the later to `build-dev`.
- [releng] Switch to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v3.4.1[Spring Boot 3.4.1].
As part of this switch, the way we redirect the HTTP requests of frontend views to the `index.html` file on the backend has been updated.
The previous strategy relied on an odd configuration of the `WebMvcConfigurer#addResourceHandlers` in order to redirect those requests to the `index.html` file.
Now that the behavior of this method https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/33712[has been changed in Spring Framework] to only support folders as valid locations, we must update to https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc-functional.html#webmvc-fn-resource[the recommended way] to perform the routing of single page applications.
This may have some consequences for downstream applications which are embedding static resources.
- [releng] Upgrade `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui` from 2.5.0 to version 2.8.3.
- [releng] Upgrade `swagger-annotations-jakarta` from 2.2.21 to 2.2.27
- [releng] Upgrade Sirius Desktop dependency to version 7.4.6

=== New Features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4356[#4356] [diagram] Add a minimap to diagram.
+ Added by default to all sirius-web diagrams
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4346[#4346] [query] Add support for a query view.
Specifiers can contribute dedicated AQL services for this feature using implementations of `IInterpreterJavaServiceProvider`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4346[#4346] [core] The field `Object#iconURLs` has been added to the GraphQL schema in order to retrieve the icon of an object
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4346[#4346] [query] Add some feedback for long running evaluations
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4338[#4338] [core] A Spring log group dedicated to performance issues has been created.
As a result, one can use `logging.level.sirius.web.performance=DEBUG` in order to display key performance metrics in a Sirius Web instance.
Some log messages have been updated in order to provide more information and make them easier to read to identify key performance issues.
The configuration property `sirius.web.graphql.tracing` has also been added to active the tracing mode of the GraphQL API.
It can be activated using `sirius.web.graphql.tracing=true` since it is not enabled by default to not have any impact on the performance of the application.
Some additional log has also been contributed on the frontend in order to view more easily the order and time of the GraphQL requests and responses.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4430[#4430] [diagram] Add the PNG export of a diagram.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4346[#4346] [query] The current selection is now available using both the variables `selection: Sequence{Object}` for the full selection and `self: Object` for the first selected object.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4446[#4446] [sirius-web] Added a new interface `org.eclipse.sirius.web.infrastructure.configuration.mvc.IBackendPathPredicate` which can be used to declare additional paths that should be handled by the backend itself instead of left to the frontend router.
This can be used to add support for new kinds of static resources (e.g. PDF files) or new Spring controllers.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4346[#4346] [query] Deactivate the spell checker on the query view
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4404[#4404] [sirius-web] The extension point `navigationBarIconExtensionPoint` can now let specifiers customize fully the appearance and behavior of the top left icon
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4193[#4193] [core] Implement Project Data Versioning REST APIs.
The new endpoints are:
** getBranches (`GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/branches`): Get all branches in the given project. There is only one branch per project in Sirius Web for now, and its Id is the same as the project Id. It represents the current state of the project, without taking care of data created/updated/deleted since the creation of the project.
** createBranch (`POST /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/branches`): Create a branch in the given project. There is only one branch per project in Sirius Web for now, so the default implementation of this method does nothing.
** getBranchById (`GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/branches/{branchId}`): Get the branch represented by its Id for the given project. There is only one branch per project in Sirius Web for now, and its Id is the same as the project Id. It represents the current state of the project, without taking care of data created/updated/deleted since the creation of the project.
** deleteBranch (`DELETE /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/branches/{branchId}`): Delete the branch with the given Id in the given project. There is only one branch per project in Sirius Web for now, so the default implementation of this method does nothing.

It can be used to add new elements before/after the default UI or to completely replace the UI with another one if needed.
Because this new extension point offers complete control of this part of the UI, the `editProjectNavbarSubtitleExtensionPoint` has been removed.
See `PapayaExtensionRegistry.tsx` for how the same result as before can be achieved with the new extension point.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4233[#4233] [core] Add cursor-based pagination for Project related GET REST APIs.
New optional attributes are available on all Project related GET REST APIs returning a list of objects, allowing to paginate the data returned by those APIs.
The following APIs are concerned:
** getProjects (`GET /api/rest/projects`)
The new optional attributes are:
** `page[size]` specifies the maximum number of records that will be returned per page in the response
** `page[before]` specifies the URL of the page succeeding the page being requested
** `page[after]` specifies the URL of a page preceding the page being requested
If neither `page[before]` nor `page[after]` is specified, the first page is returned with the same number of records as specified in the `page[size]` query parameter.
If the `page[size]` parameter is not specified, then the default page size is used, which is 20.
Example:
 ** `http://my-sirius-web-server:8080/api/rest/projects?
page[after]=MTYxODg2MTQ5NjYzMnwyMDEwOWY0MC00ODI1LTQxNmEtODZmNi03NTA4YWM0MmEwMjE&
page[size]=3` will ask for the 3 projects following the one identified by the URL of the page succeeding the page being requested `MTYxODg2MTQ5NjYzMnwyMDEwOWY0MC00ODI1LTQxNmEtODZmNi03NTA4YWM0MmEwMjE`.
Note that you can retrieve the URL of a page in the response header of `GET /api/rest/projects`.
Note that you may need to encode special characters like `[`(by `%5B`) and `]` (by `%5D`) in your requests.

=== Deprecation warning

- [form] The project `sirius-components-collaborative-forms` has always decided that any change performed by a widget must be a `ChangeKind.SEMANTIC_CHANGE`.
This decision has created some limit on what can really be edited by a form.
We will soon change this default behavior to use the change kind and parameters returned by the specifier in the `Success` result from the event handler.
As a result, if we consider a textfield widget, in order to keep the existing behavior, specifier will have to create a result with the proper change kind like `new Success(ChangeKind.SEMANTIC_CHANGE, Map.of())` instead of `new Success()`.
If the status returned by the event handler is still something like `new Success()` then, Sirius Components will ignore the change performed by the event handler.
While it can be useful to indicate that nothing has changed in some cases, if it's not done on purpose some representations will not be updated, semantic data may not be saved, etc.
This change will also be propagated over time to other kind of representations.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4190[#4190] [core] The graphQL type `RepresentationMetadata` has now a property to hold icons for the representation.
This can be retrieve using either `EditingContext#representations` or `EditingContext#representation`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4192[#4192] [core] `IRepresentationDescription` has a new provide `getIconURLsProvider`.
This provider is in charge of getting the icon list of the representation.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4192[#4192] [tree] The expression `TreeDescription#iconURLExpression` has now been replaced by `TreeDescription#itemIconExpression`, in a similar fashion the provider `TreeDescription#iconURLProvider` has been replaced by `TreeDescription#treeItemIconURLsProvider` not to be confused with the newly introduced `TreeDescription#iconURLsProvider`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4286[#4286] [sirius-web] Make default explorer drag and drop work only for the default explorer

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4193[#4193] [core] Implement Project Data Versioning REST APIs.
The new endpoints are:
** getCommits (`GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits`): Get all commits in the given project. There is only one commit per project in Sirius Web for now, and its Id is the same as the project Id. It represents the current state of the project, without taking care of data created/updated/deleted since the creation of the project.
** createCommit (`POST /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits`): Create a commit in the given project. There is only one commit per project in Sirius Web for now, so the default implementation of this method does nothing.
** getCommitById (`GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}`): Get the commit represented by its Id for the given project. There is only one commit per project in Sirius Web for now, and its Id is the same as the project Id. It represents the current state of the project, without taking care of data created/updated/deleted since the creation of the project.
** getCommitChange (`GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/changes`): Get all changes of the commit represented by its Id for the given project. There is only one commit per project in Sirius Web for now, and its Id is the same as the project Id. The default implementation retrieves all elements containing in the project, without taking care of data created/updated/deleted since the creation of the project.
** getCommitChangeById (`GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/changes/{changeId}`): Get the changes associated to the given change Id for the commit represented by its Id for the given project. There is only one commit per project in Sirius Web for now, and its Id is the same as the project Id. The default implementation retrieves all changes containing in the project, without taking care of data created/updated/deleted since the creation of the project. The change Id parameter should be randomly generated but constant for an unlimited period. We decided to generate this Id from it's commit Id and element Id, to be able to compute it.
A new `IProjectDataVersioningRestServiceDelegate` interface is available, allowing to customize the default implementation of services related to Project Data Versioning related REST APIs.
Specifiers can implement this new interface with a spring `Service`.
A new `IRestDataVersionPayloadSerializerService` interface is available, allowing to customize the default implementation of the JSON serialization of the payload object of `RestDataVersion`.
Specifiers are also encouraged to implement their own `IRestDataVersionPayloadSerializerService` for their domains, as the default one may not return expected results.

=== Deprecation warning


=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3846[#3846] [core] Migrate frontend to React 18, you now need React 18 to import sirius web modules.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3875[#3875] [sirius-web] The `ExplorerView` component has been moved from `sirius-components-trees` to `sirius-web-application` module
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3155[#3155] [core] All the paths in the code involving the modification of some data (project, semantic data, representation data, etc.) will now require a new parameter `ICause cause` which is the cause of this change.
Both `IInput` and `IDomainEvent` implement `ICause` and will thus be used to indicate which action has triggered the change.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3763[#3763] [core] updates some services behavior:
** The `org.eclipse.sirius.components.emf.services.DefaultIdentityService#getId(Object object)` Can now provides the Id if the Object is of type `org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.Resource`. Before this change, it would have returned null.
** The `org.eclipse.sirius.components.emf.services.DefaultLabelService` Can now provides the label if the Object is of type `org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.Resource`. Before this change, it would have returned an empty string.
** The `org.eclipse.sirius.components.emf.services.DefaultContentService#getContents(Object)` Can now provides the content if the Object is of type `org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.Resource`. Before this change, it would have returned an empty list.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3972[#3972] [diagram] The `InsideLabelStyle#displayHeaderSeparator` has been renamed to `headerSeparatorDisplayMode` and is no longer a boolean but an enum with three possible values: NEVER, ALWAYS, and IF-CHILDREN.
Previously, the value false was equivalent to NEVER, and true to IF-CHILDREN.
The new option ALWAYS allows the separator to be displayed in every case.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3678[#3678] [core] Remove `IRepresentationMetadataSearchService#findByRepresentation`, use `IRepresentationMetadataSearchService#findByRepresentationId` instead.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4050[#4050] [sirius-web] `IUploadFileLoader` must now return an `IResult`.
This allows an error to be displayed when there is a problem during uploading
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4037[#4037] [tree] The tree item id passed to `ITreeQueryService.findTreeItem` is no longer a UUID but is now a String.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4077[#4077] [charts] Remove `interface RepresentationMetadata` from `BarChart.types.ts`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3840[#3840] [diagram] Migrate to ReactFlow 12, if you have components that uses the library then you'll need to update them.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2399[#2399] [core] When executing successive model operations inside a tool, the execution context (variables, in particular `self`) of all sibling operations now stays the same.
This is much more natural and closer to the behavior of usual languages, but change the behavior.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3679[#3679] [core] Split representation metadata from content
+ Remove `org.eclipse.sirius.components.core.api.IRepresentationMetadataSearchService` and its implementation.
+ Use `org.eclipse.sirius.web.domain.boundedcontexts.representationdata.services.api.IRepresentationMetadataSearchService#findAllMetadataByTargetObjectId` instead of `org.eclipse.sirius.components.core.api.IRepresentationMetadataSearchService#findAllByTargetObjectId`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3679[#3679] [sirius-web] The service `hasChildren` requires the editing context like the aql service `getChildren`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3983[#3983] [tree] The `TreeDescription` must now implement a `dropTreeItemHandler`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3680[#3680] [core] The label has been removed from the content of all representations.
+ The label of a representation is available through its metadata that can be retrieve thanks to the service `IRepresentationMetadataSearchService` from sirius-web-domain or, `IRepresentationMetadataProvider` from sirius-components-collaborative.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/4114[#4114] [sirius-web] The `projectActionButtonMenuItemExtensionPoint` extension point has been removed.
Use the new `projectContextMenuEntryExtensionPoint` instead which allows the contribution of actual `MenuItem` components instead of just props.
See `ProjectDownloadMenuItemExtension` for an example.
_Warning:_ while more powerful, the new extension point should be used with care: make sure all contributions return an actual MUI `MenuItem` component.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3681[#3681] [sirius-web] Replace all representation specific rename event handlers by `RenameRepresentationEventHandler`.
+ It means that an application that only use sirius-components should provide its own means to rename a representation.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3980[#3980] [core] Removed the _label_ attribute from `WorkbenchSelectionEntry` (backend, GraphQL Schema and frontend).

 * The `SelectionDescription` type has been renamed into `SelectionDialogDescription` and inherit from `DialogDescription`.
 * The `InvokeSingleClickOnDiagramElementToolInput#selectedObjectId` has been replaced by a `variables: [ToolVariable!]!` to make it possible to provide any kind of variable to the backend context.

```
 input InvokeSingleClickOnDiagramElementToolInput {
  id: ID!
  editingContextId: ID!
  representationId: ID!
  variables: [ToolVariable!]!
  diagramElementId: ID!
  startingPositionX: Float!

This includes maven modules such as `sirius-web-persistence`, `sirius-web-services`, `sirius-web-graphql` among others.
They will be replaced by the maven modules of the new architecture used by `sirius-web`.
The removal of those deprecated modules will occur during the iteration 2024.9.0.


=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3271[#3271] [test] Move `IGraphQLRequestor` to `org.eclipse.sirius.components.graphql.tests.api`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3088[#3088] [diagram] Some changes have been made in the View DSL for diagram:
* attribute `labelExpression` has been renamed to `centerLabelExpression` for edges
* attribute `labelExpression` has been removed from `NodeDescription` in favor of `InsideLabelDescription`
+
For further information, please refer to ADR _130_add_support_for_outside_inside_node_labels.adoc_
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3237[#3237] [diagram] Update the name of the `diagramEvent` variable to `diagramEvents` to reflect that events are now stored in a list.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2567[#2567] [form] The `Slider` widget is now a standard widget
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2567[#2567] [form] The TypeScript API used to contribute custom widgets has changed a little to fix some types which could not work in a strict TypeScript environment.
The use of generics has thus been greatly reduced since they could not create a set of coherent TypeScript type signatures.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3279[#3279] [core] Remove `IRepresentationRefreshPolicyRegistry#add` since it can easily be replaced with a plain old Spring service dependency injection
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3279[#3279] [core] Remove the field `EditingContext#stereotypeDescriptions` from `core.graphqls` since it is not provided by Sirius Components and only used by Sirius Web
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3279[#3279] [core] Remove all references to the Stereotype API from `sirius-components-core` since it has always been a Sirius Web API.
This will make the dependency to the old Sirius Web architecture more explicit.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3279[#3279] [sirius-web] Simplify the lifecycle and API of the documentation creation in order to provide a simpler yet more powerful API for the new architecture
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3279[#3279] [sirius-web] The custom nodes project and its edit project have been renamed from `sirius-web-customnodes{-edit}` to `sirius-components-view-diagram-customnodes{-edit}` and moved to match other view based projects.
They are also now used by the view builder code generator.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3382[#3382] [diagram] Remove the hardcoded show/hide tools in the frontend and move it to the backend.
Specifiers now need to manually add the hide tools they want in their node/edge palette.
New default implementations are available in `DefaultToolsFactory` to ease the migration.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3304[#3304] [core] The `ISemanticRepresentation` interface has been removed.
Its single method, `getTargetObjectId`, has been moved up into the main `IRepresentation` interface.
For representations which were *not* `ISemanticRepresentation` before, their target object is the `IEditingContext` itself if nothing more relevant is available.
Accordingly, `IObjectSearchService` and `IIdentityService` now handle actual `IEditingContext` instances as objects.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3425[#3425] [diagram] In our GraphQL schema, `DiagramDescription` must now declare an `ArrangeLayoutDirection`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2655[#2655] [diagram] Add optional `calculateCustomNodeEdgeHandlePosition` method to `INodeLayoutHandler`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3456[#3456] [diagram] `ConnectionTargetHandle` now expects `isHovered` props for custom nodes
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3391[#3391] [diagram] Some changes have been made in the View DSL for diagram:
* super types `style` has been removed from `NodeStyleDescription`
* attribute `background` has been added to `RectangularNodeStyleDescription` and `IconLabelNodeStyleDescription`

- [ADR-137] Use a common identification strategy for transient representations
- [ADR-138] Allow consumers to reuse smaller parts of the Sirius Web backend


=== Deprecation warning

- The type `RenameProjectSuccessPayload` and `DeletedProjectSuccessPayload` will be replaced by `SuccessPayload`
- The type `DeleteRepresentationSuccessPayload` will be replaced by `SuccessPayload`
- The mutation `createRepresentation` and `deleteRepresentation` and their datafetcher will be entirely managed by Sirius Components
- The interface `IEditingContextEPackageService` should be deleted since we now have access to editing context preprocessors which can be used to contribute packages to editing context and even more.
- Remove the image for resources from `sirius-components-compatibility` and `org.eclipse.sirius.components.compatibility.services.ImageConstants`.

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3010[#3010] [form] The reference widget has been updated.
On backend side, `clickHandler` has been removed from `ReferenceValue`.
`itemClickHandlerProvider` has been removed from `ReferenceWidgetDescription`.
EventHandler & DataFetcher on widget reference item click action have also been deleted.
The reference widget graphql schema and the frontend have been updated accordingly.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2822[#2822] [diagram] The GraphQL type `Edge` must now implement `labelEditable` boolean field.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2783[#2783] [diagram] Remove the package `sirius-components-diagrams` containing the Sprotty based implementation of our diagrams
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2783[#2783] [diagram] Rename the package `sirius-components-diagrams-reactflow` to `sirius-components-diagrams` since we only have one implementation now
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2783[#2783] [diagram] Remove the modules `sirius-components-diagrams-layout-api` and `sirius-components-diagrams-layout` in favor of the frontend based layout API.
As a result, all the APIs relying on this code have been deleted too such as the dead code used to export diagrams on the server or the API for parametric SVGs which was replaced in Reactflow based diagrams.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3020[#3020] [sirius-web] Remove the component `Views` and its dependencies in favor of a more straightforward API.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2823[#2823] [diagram] Some changes have been made for node layout, there may be an impact on the custom node.
* `getNodeOrMinWidth` and `getNodeOrMinHeight` have been renamed `getDefaultOrMinWidth` and `getDefaultOrMinHeight`.
* `computePreviousSize` no longer returns `{0,0}` when it's a new node but its default size.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2606[#2606] [diagram] Add the attributes `topGap` and `bottomGap` to graphql `ListLayoutStrategy`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3042[#3042] [core] IObjectService have been divided in smaller API IContentService, IObjectSearchService, IIdentityService and ILabelService.
If you used the default implementation of `IObjectService` you can still use it to retrieve the default implementation of the new services.
Yet we are recommending using each individual services since this aggregated one may be deprecated in the future.
If you want to add your own custom behavior, please use the new services, see the related ADR for more details.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3066[#3066] [core] `IObjectSearchService`, `IIdentityService`, `ILabelService` now can also find/resolve representations.
This changes a core assumption from before where an element known to those services (i.e. an element for which `IIdentityService.getId` returned a non-null value) was a "semantic element" and thus *could not be* a representation.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3021[#3021] [sirius-web] Remove the interfaces `IRepresentationDescriptionRegistry` and `IRepresentationDescriptionRegistryConfigurer` to replace them with `IEditingContextRepresentationDescriptionProvider` which provides the same feature but also gives access to the editing context for conditional registration of representation descriptions.
This new interface will move in the near future from `sirius-components-core` to `sirius-web-application`.
It's current location is only there to simplify the transition to the new Sirius Web architecture.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3021[#3021] [sirius-web] Make the `ISuggestedRootObjectTypesProvider` optional in `sirius-components-emf` in order to be able to reuse this maven module without the Sirius Desktop compatibility one.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3019[#3019] [emf] Remove the dependency from `sirius-components-emf` to the validation representation.
Reusing the EMF compatibility layer will not add any dependency to specific representations.
The EMF validation support will now be provided by `sirius-web-services`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3156[#3156] [core] In our GraphQL schema, `Viewer` is now a type instead of an interface.
Having `Viewer` as a type did not bring any additional value and it created some overhead by having to create and keep updated an additional type without any benefit.
- [sirius-web] The field `ChangeKind.PROJECT_RENAMING` has been deleted since it does not make any sense in Sirius Components.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2713[#2713] [diagram] Add the attribute `growableNodeIds` to graphql `ListLayoutStrategy`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3019[#3019] [core] Add `CoreImageConstants.DEFAULT_SVG` to retrieve the default svg image from `sirius-components-core` instead of the now deleted `ImageConstants.DEFAULT_SVG` from `sirius-components-compatibility`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3019[#3019] [core] Move the `WidgetIdProvider` from `sirius-components-compatibility` to `sirius-components-forms` to remove unnecessary dependencies to the Sirius Desktop compatibility layer.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3019[#3019] [core] Move the EMF based default description of the details view from `sirius-components-compatibility-emf` to `sirius-components-emf-forms` since there are no dependency between the default description of the details view and the Sirius Desktop compatibility layer.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3096[#3096] [tree] `TreeConfiguration` has a new parameter `List<String> activeFilterIds`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3019[#3019] [form] Allow consumers of Sirius Components to reuse the reference widget without the form description editor or the view DSL.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3246[#3246] [view] Remove representation specific code from `ViewRepresentationDescriptionSearchService`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3250[#3250] [form] Change the base package of the reference widget from `org.eclipse.sirius.components.widgets.reference` to `org.eclipse.sirius.components.widgets.reference.view`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3303[#3303] [core] The identifiers for all transient representations have changed.
They are now more uniform and more importantly clearly distinct from persisted representations (which all use plain UUIDs):
** Explorer: `explorer://?expandedIds=[...]&activeFilterIds=[...]`
** Details: `details://?objectIds=[...]`
** Validation: `validation://`
** RelatedElements: `relatedElements://?objectIds=[...]`
** Representations: `representations://?objectIds=[...]`
** Selection: `selection://`

A new optional component named `DiagramRepresentationConfiguration` has been introduced.
If you want to add some custom nodes, this new component must be declared under `SiriusWebApplication`:
```ts
const nodeTypeRegistry: NodeTypeRegistry = {
  ...
};
<SiriusWebApplication httpOrigin={httpOrigin} wsOrigin={wsOrigin}>
  <DiagramRepresentationConfiguration nodeTypeRegistry={nodeTypeRegistry} />
</SiriusWebApplication>
```
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2790[#2790] [diagram] All handles used to resize a node have been updated to be wider, you can update your custom nodes in the same way it's done in the EllipseNode example.

== v2023.12.0

=== Shapes

- Add support for custom nodes in Diagram representations
- Add the possibility to specify a size ratio on node.
- Add support for rotatable border node
- Improve handles management in React Flow based diagrams

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-111] Add support for image overlay
- [ADR-112] Provide only valid view descriptions to the renderer
- [ADR-113] Add support for multiple IObjectService
- [ADR-114] Add support for multiple IEditService
- [ADR-115] Split the Sirius Web frontend
- [ADR-116] Add support for changing the content of the explorer
- [ADR-117] Add support for changing the content of the details view

- [ADR-119] Share layout data between subscribers
- [ADR-120] Improve the arrange all action with reactflow
- [ADR-121] Add process before and after input handling

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2386[#2386] [form] Reference widget structure has changed, `referenceOptions` has been removed to be lazily loaded.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2329[#2335] [form] The general mutation `editReference` has been removed from the reference widget. This mutation has been replaced by finer grain mutations:
** _clearReference_ mutation: to reset the content references (set the value to `null` for mono-valued references and to an empty list for multi-valued ones).
** _addReferenceValues_ mutation: to several reference values to a reference (only used with multi-valued references)
** _setReferenceValue_ mutation: to set the value of mono-valued references
** _removeReferenceValue_ mutation: to remove a given value from a reference (in case of mono-valued references, this mutation is equivalent to _clearReference_)
** _createElementInReference_ mutation: to create a new element (used in the context of a reference widget)
** _moveReferenceValue_ mutation: to reorder the list of values in multi-valued references

UI is unchanged except that we removed the transactional behavior of the _TransferModal_ component which is now performing operations live. This means that changes are no longer done when the modal is close (using the _Apply_ button) but as soon as the user interacts with elements (adding or removing values, changing order).

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2269[#2269] [core] The GraphQL field `EditingContext#domains` has been modified.
A new parameter `rootDomainsOnly: Boolean` has been added, allowing to remove domains not compatible with root objects.
For example, Diagram & Form domains are not root domains because `DiagramDescription` and `FormDescription` are not root objects valid candidates.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/1712[#1712] [diagram] The GraphQL type `Node` must now implement `isLabelEditable` boolean field.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2456[#2456] [sirius-web] The GraphQL field `CreateChildSuccessPayload` now expects to have a list of messages.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/1982[#1982] [diagram] Change the diagram structure. The Node's 'label' attribute has been renamed into 'insideLabel' and its type changed from `Label` to `InsideLabel` (which is currently identical to `Label` except for the name).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2388[#2388] [core] The `IObjectService.getImagePath` API changed and now must return a list containing all the image paths to compose/overlay.
Due to this data structure modification, all existing diagrams can no longer be opened.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2460[#2460] [form] The reference widget no longer declares a `createElementHandlerProvider`, this feature is delegated to the new service `IReferenceWidgetCreateElementHandler`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2453[#2453] [diagram] The GraphQL fields `DeleteFromDiagramSuccessPayload`, `EditLabelSuccessPayload` and `DropOnDiagramSuccessPayload` now expects to have a list of messages.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2514[#2514] [diagram] Move and rename the RectangleNodeStyle `withHeader` attribute to InsideLabel `isHeader`.
It requires to add a `isHeaderProvider` to the _LabelDescription_ of Node.
Replace only for the programmatic API the _LabelDescription_ type in _NodeDescription_ by _InsideLabelDescription_ and add the inside label location.
Update the graphql API accordingly.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2444[#2444] [form] `ViewFormDescriptionConverterSwitch` now extends `FormSwitch<Optional<AbstractControlDescription>>`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2516[#2516] [diagram] Add to the diagram core API the possibility to display the header separator when the inside label is a header.
It requires to add a `displayHeaderSeparatorProvider` to the _InsideLabelDescription_.
For the compatibility layer, the separator will always be displayed if the label is inside a node displaying its children has a list.
Add the attribute `displayHeaderSeparator` to the graphql API.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2535[#2535] [view] Add the possibility for the header separator to be displayed or hidden in the View DSL.
+
.Compartment with header without separator
image:doc/screenshots/compartmentWithHeaderWithoutSeparator.png[Compartment with header without separator,30%]
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2255[#2255] [diagram] The properties `widthComputationExpression` and `heightComputationExpression` have been removed from `NodeStyleDescription`.
From now on, use the `defaultWidthExpression` and `defaultHeightExpression` properties from `NodeDescription`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2537[#2537] [sirius-web] `sirius-web` frontend package has been split in two: `sirius-web` and `sirius-web-application`.
The package `sirius-web` now depends on `sirius-web-application`.
A new component `SiriusWebApplication` has been added.
Developers who want to create a `sirius-web` frontend should use this component as their root component.
The API of this component will change over time in order to provide additional capabilities.
API breaks should be expected.
+
Another component, named `Views` has also been added.
This component will allow developers to customize some parts of the Sirius Web views.
It will currently provide the ability to customize the application icon and application menu.
The API of this component will also change over time so API breaks should be expected in the upcoming releases.
+
This new package and those new components are the first part of our work to make Sirius Web more reusable.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2615[#2615] [diagram] `useDropNode().dropFeedbackStyleProvider` has been removed.
Use `useDropNodeStyle(node.id)` instead to get the feedback of the drop feedback.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2671[#2671] [diagram] Switch to Reactflow by default.
To open a diagram with Sprotty, suffixes the diagram name with `__SPROTTY`

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2386[#2386] [form] Reference widget candidates are now lazily loaded when necessary.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2424[#2424] [view] Align the format of description id used in Form generated from View with the one used in diagram.
As a result, the identifier of a form description created from a view model will not be an UUID anymore but instead an URL based identifier
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2335[#2335] [form] Change the capabilities of the reference widget to open it to more customization.
In order to provide a first version of those capabilities, some additional coupling has been created between the reference widget and its use in Sirius Web which may prevent its use in other applications.
This coupling will be removed in the near future as a consequence, the dependencies of this code will change and some APIs of the reference widget will be broken in the near future.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2380[#2380] [diagram] Add typing to reactflow hooks
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2430[#2430] [diagram] Improve fit to screen feature to zoom on selected nodes

It is now possible to contribute specific services to interact with domain objects, through `IObjectServiceDelegate`.
The new implementation of `IObjectService`, named `ComposedObjectService`, tries first to delegate to the appropriate `IObjectServiceDelegate` and then fallback to a default behavior from `IDefaultObjectService` if needed.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2530[#2530] [core] Add support for multiple `IEditService`.
It is now possible to contribute specific services to edit domain objects, through `IEditServiceDelegate`.
The new implementation of `IEditService`, named `ComposedEditService`, tries first to delegate to the appropriate `IEditServiceDelegate` and then fallback to a default behavior from `IDefaultEditService` if needed.

- [ADR-110] Color Management in View

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/2250[#2250] [core] Remove all references to notistack from `sirius-components-core`.
As a result, the link between notistack and Sirius Components needs to be updated in applications using Sirius Components.
See the Sirius Web `ToastProvider` and `ToastContextInitializer` to see how to give Sirius Components the relevant function(s) from notistack.
Without the dependency to notistack in `sirius-components-core`, it will be easier to leverage native VS Code popup to display our errors.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2259[#2259] [tree] [sirius-web] Move the `NewDocumentModal` and the `UploadDocumentModal` from `sirius-components-tree` to `sirius-web`.
We introduced the `TreeToolBarContribution` components to contribute actions to the `TreeToolBar` such as the `NewDocumentModal` and the `UploadDocumentModal`.
As a result, the `NewDocumentModal` and the `UploadDocumentModal` will not be available in applications.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2270[#2270] [core] [sirius-web] Move `DeleteProjectModal`, `NewObjectModal`, `NewRepresentationModal`, `NewRootObjectModal` and `RenameProjectModal` from `sirius-components` to `sirius-web``.
As a result, they will not be available in the Sirius Components packages anymore, and thus, applications that need such modals will need to implement them.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2274[#2274] [core] Remove the `Form` and `FormContainer` components.
They will not be provided by the `sirius-components` package anymore.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2276[#2276] [core] [sirius-web] Move the `ErrorBoundary` HOC into sirius-web.
It is not available for applications anymore, and thus, applications that need a global error handling strategy will need to implement it by themselves.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2279[#2279] [core] Remove the package `sirius-components`.
All of its remaining content was only relevant inside of Sirius Web and it has thus been migrated to this location
- [releng] Stop minifying the code of Sirius Components packages.
As a result the development of applications consuming Sirius Components packages will be easier and it will be the responsibility of the application to minify everything (which they should already be doing).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2296[#2296] [diagram] `sirius-components-diagrams-reactflow` now depends on `html-to-image` node package.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2236[#2236] [form] The introduction of _ForDescription_ and _IfDescription_ elements to the Forms DSL introduced breaking changes in the metamodel.
Existing FormDescription documents will need to be modified to load correctly, and any custom widget's metamodel will need to be regenerated using the new `form.ecore` version as reference.
See [ADR-107] _Add support for dynamic and conditional widgets in Forms_ for the details of the changes.
Also, all widget descriptions now have a `Function<VariableManager, String> targetObjectIdProvider`, needed to compute the widget instance's id.
The new `targetObjectIdProvider` is required to be non-null, so any code which programmatically builds core Form Descriptions (not View-based ones), needs to pass a non-null provider.
A suitable implementation is to get the id of the `self` object using `IObjectService.getId()`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2118[#2118] [form] The introduction of the new modal for create objects with the reference widget, apply changes for two queries `rootObjectCreationDescriptions` and `childCreationDescriptions`.
It's now possible to provide _referenceKind_ to only get the `ChildCreationDescription` matching this _reference_.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2253[#2253] [diagram] The introduction of ToolSection in palette, change the _DiagramDescription_ structure by adding a new level _Palette_ instead of _[ToolSection]_.
Note that _palette_ will be removed in short-term from the _DiagramDescription_.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2329[#2329] [form] Split of `sirius-components-widget-reference` to extract EMF-related code into a new module `sirius-components-collaborative-widget-reference`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2252[#2252] [diagram] The support for React Flow based diagrams now require a `DiagramPaletteToolContext` in order to contribute custom palette tool.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2343[#2343] [sirius-web] Add iconURL field on `ChildCreationDescription` type.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2371[#2371] [view] Colors are now required everywhere.
We will not hardcoded decisions in our application, instead all the references to a color should be configured.
In the near future, the GraphQL schema and the frontend of `sirius-components-forms` will thus be updated to reflect this new change.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2371[#2371] [sirius-web] Default colors are now loaded from a default model located in `sirius-components-view/src/main/resources/studioColorPalettes.json`.
They are loaded in every studio project but hidden in the explorer.
They are also made readonly in the details view.
Applications derived from Sirius Web may have to ensure that references to default colors are properly resolved when loading a view model.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2191[#2191] [view] The Color property on ImageNodeStyle has been removed.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2388[#2388] [tree] `treeItem` is no longer composed of a single string for the imageURL, but of a list of strings to take into account composite images.
The `IObjectService.getImagePath` API changed and now must return a list containing all the image paths.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2789[#2789] [diagram] Added the file ReactFlow.css to sirius-web package.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2118[#2118] [form] Add a modal to create new objects on a widget reference
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2253[#2253] [diagram] Add the possibility of organizing palette tools into sections
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2236[#2236] [form] It is now possible to use `For` and `If` constructs inside the definition of Form (currently only inside _Groups_ and _Flexbox containers_).
Both constructs are commonly combined together, with e.g. _For_ iterating on the different features of the current semantic element and several _If_ inside the loop to decide which concrete widget(s) to instantiate depending on the feature's type.
They can however also be used independently (e.g. a single _If_ outside of a _For_ to make the presence of a widget conditional) and combined in arbitrary ways (e.g. nested loops or conditionals).
Note that this first version has a known limitation: _FormDescriptions_ which use _For_ or _If_ elements can not be reliably edited using the _Form Description Editor_.
This will be fixed in the next version.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2254[#2254] [diagram] Add the possibility to specify precondition on diagram tools

== v2023.8.0

=== Shapes

- Add disable / enable concept for widgets
- Add new custom widget to edit single and multi-valued references
- Add support for Help Expressions in Form widgets
- Add border style for containers
- Add an API for filtering and ordering form pages

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-103] Improves the existing feedback messages capability
- [ADR-104] Add support for Help Expressions in Form widgets
- [ADR-105] Add custom widget to edit EMF references
- [ADR-106] Add the support for the palette with react flow

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/2080[#2080] [tree] EditingContextRepresentationDataFetcher will filter on IRepresentation instead of ISemanticRepresentation to be able to support TreeDescription.
+
As such targetObjectId is removed from RepresentationMetadata.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/2124[#2124] [sirius-web,emf] The `org.eclipse.sirius.web.services.documents.DocumentMetadataAdapter` has been renamed `ResourceMetadataAdapter` and moved to the `org.eclipse.sirius.components.emf` package (in `sirius-components-emf`).
This allows for code which does not depend on Sirius Web and the Document notion to properly display the top-level elements of a project in the UI.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/2126[#2126] [tree] The `IExplorerDescriptionProvider` interface has been removed.
The `TreeDescription` used by the _Explorer_ view is now registered using the general `IRepresentationDescriptionRegistryConfigurer` (see `ExplorerDescriptionProvider`).

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1988[#1988] All Form widgets can now define (if relevant) a dynamically computed "help text".
Widgets which define such a help text have a new "?" icon next to their labels; the actual help text is accessible as a tooltip on this icon.
For View-based widgets, this materializes as an AQL `helpExpression`.
The help text can include multiple lines (separated by `\n`), but no text formatting.
+
image:doc/images/Widget_Help_Tooltip.png[Example of a help tooltip on a widget]
+
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/2048[#2048] [diagram] Add a basic support for the resize.
It is possible to reduce the size of a node less than the space needed to display all children.

These should be registered globally like other representations using a `IRepresentationDescriptionRegistryConfigurer`.
Their `TreeDescription.getCanCreatePredicate()` will be invoked with a `treeId` variable (a string) to test if it handles a given tree subscription requested by the front.
For example the main _Explorer_ frontend component subscribes to the `treeEvent` subscription with a `treeId` of `'explorer://'`, and the backend `ExplorerDescriptionProvider`'s tests for `treeId.startsWith("explorer://")` to indicate it is the one to use to handle this subscription.

All the colors are now defined in a new palette object _ColorPalette_ with the properties _name_ and _value_.
A view can define as many _ColorPalette_ as desired.
In the _styleDescription_, the definition of a color are now a select list of all the colors contained in the _ColorPalette_ of the view
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1970[#1970] [diagram] Simplify the lifecycle of the diagram creation and refresh.
For that, the `DiagramCreationService` will have less responsibilities.
Starting now, it will stop persisting the diagram after its creation.
It will start by improving a bit performances since diagrams were persisted twice in some use cases.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1915[#1915] [view] Add the page support in the view DSL.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/2018[#2018] [formdescriptioneditors] Fixed form editor selection to display the page containing the first element selected.

=== New Features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1883[#1883] [sirius-web] Add the possibility to programmatically set some metadata such as specifics natures to a project.
These natures can be used later to enable or not some capabilities on a project.
This work will start by adding the ability to filter the project's domains.
A large set of features will have to be updated in order to stop considering the list of metamodels available in an editing context as a certainty.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1946[#1946] Enabled child extenders in the View DSL implementation.
This allows downstream projects and applications to provide their own sub-types of the DSL types (e.g. new WidgetDescriptions).
In addition to registering the extension metamodel itself, users must provide a `ChildExtenderProvider` bean for their extensions to be properly integrated.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1918[#1918] [tree] Its is now possible to filter tree items in trees.
After selected a tree item, hit Ctrl+f (or Cmd+f on macOS) to enable the filter bar.
+
image:doc/screenshots/filterBar.png[Filter Bar,30%,30%]
+
All visible tree items containing the value typed in the filter bar will be highlighted.
The filter button inside the filter bar allows to filter (hide) all visible tree items not containing the value typed in the filter bar.
+
image:doc/screenshots/filterBarFilterButton.png[Filter Bar Filter Button,30%,30%]
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1914[#1914] [form] It is now possible for applications to provide their own custom widgets without forking Sirius Components.
See link:doc/how-to/contribute-custom-widget.adoc[the documentation] for more details.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1830[#1830] [layout] This feature is experimental and can be activated on a diagram by adding "__EXPERIMENTAL" to its name.
The new algorithm does the minimum possible to place node without overlap.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1985[|#1985] [sirius-web] It is now possible to use in-memory View-based representations by registering them in the new `InMemoryViewRegistry`.
These representations can be created programmatically or loaded from `.view` EMF models on startup, and do not need to be stored as documents inside a project in the database.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1921[#1921] [view] Added a project sirius-components-view-builder.
+
Introducing providers interfaces to help creating view programmatically.
+
Introducing a generator of builders aimed to help creating view programmatically, the generation makes use of emf-merge and modifications to these builders can be annotated to live during future regeneration.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1912[#1912] [core] Add the possibility to send feedback messages to the frontend after an action.

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1869[#1869] [tree] Navigate to the first child with the right arrow if a node is expanded.
Navigate to the parent with the left arrow if a node is collapsed
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1621[#1621] [project] Migrate the onboard area to Material-UI
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1852[#1852] [layout] Single position event takes the diagram element id and the double position event takes the source id and target id
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1971[#1971] [layout] Add the first new layout engine integration test
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1831[#1831] [layout] Improve the data structure of the layout algorithm
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1975[#1975] [emf] The getContents method from the ObjectService will use the eObject's IEditingDomainItemProvider if it exists.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1916[#1916] [sirius-web] We supply an example of how to provide your own _Details_ view definition for specific elements using a View-based FormDescription.
See `org.eclipse.sirius.web.sample.configuration.DomainPropertiesConfigurer` and `org.eclipse.sirius.web.sample.services.DomainAttributeServices` for a working example that can be easily adapted.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/2003[#2003] [view] Make reconnection tool more robust for applications which use a custom IViewRepresentationDescriptionSearchService.

== v2023.4.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-094] Provide better control on contextual palette's content
- [ADR-095] Use richer data types in the View DSL definition
- [ADR-096] Distinguish the containment kind of view creation requests
- [ADR-097] Separate the layout data structures from the diagram data structures

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1643[1643] [core] Removed our dependencies to Spring Security
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1592[#1592] [view] In View-based diagram definition, all tools applicable on a given element are now configured inside the new _Palette_ element directly inside the element (diagram, node or edge) description.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1761[#1761] [core] Remove `sirius-web-graphql-schema` since it was not really used anymore
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1825[#1825] [diagram] Distinguish the containment kind of view creation requests
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1840[#1840] [diagram] The GraphQL field Diagram#autoLayout has been removed.
We only use DiagramDescription#autoLayout to retrieve the autolayout state of a diagram.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1638[#1638] [view] The lifecycle of the representation descriptions from the view DSL is now aligned with the lifecycle of the metamodels computed from the Domain DSL.
+
As such, the representation descriptions available for an `EditingContext` are now computed and transformed when the `EditingContext` is loaded.
It will thus improve the performances of the lookup for representation descriptions since they will be referenced directly by the `EditingContext`.
This does not come with any changes to the interface `IEditingContext`.
Alternate implementations of `IEditingContext` do not have to keep the representation descriptions in their implementation of `IEditingContext`.
+
By loading representation descriptions from the View DSL when the editing context is being loaded, we are making the editing context the sole source of truth of the representation descriptions available.
+
As a result, any datafetcher requiring a representation description will now have to use the editing context event processor registry to find the requested representation description.
We previously had some datafetcher which were using the `IRepresentationDescriptionSearchService`` with `null` as a value for the editing context.
Such calls will not work anymore since `null` will not be an acceptable value anymore by our implementation of this interface.
- [diagram] Changed the type of `Node#descriptionId` and `Edge#descriptionId` from `UUID` to `String`
- [view] Changed the values of {Diagram|Node|Edge}descriptionId computed by the view converter:
** `siriusComponents://diagramDescription?sourceKind=view&sourceId=UUID_OF_DOCUMENT&sourceElementId=UUID_OF_SOURCE_ELEMENT`
** `siriusComponents://nodeDescription?sourceKind=view&sourceId=UUID_OF_DOCUMENT&sourceElementId=UUID_OF_SOURCE_ELEMENT`
** `siriusComponents://edgeDescription?sourceKind=view&sourceId=UUID_OF_DOCUMENT&sourceElementId=UUID_OF_SOURCE_ELEMENT`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1890[#1890]  [view] Tools are now retrieved from their corresponding View Description

=== New Features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1695[#1695] [view] Add a precondition expression to the node description
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1527[#1527] [diagram] Add the new layout data structure which will be used by the new version of our layout algorithm.
This new data structure will be used by the frontend if the name of a diagram ends with `__EXPERIMENTAL`.
This will allow us to easily compare the current layout algorithm and the new one.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1846[#1846] [diagram] A debug mode has been added for diagrams.
This debug mode can be activated by setting the configuration property `sirius.components.diagram.debug` to `true`.
Once activated, this debug mode will display additional information on diagram elements to help debug what has been computed by the backend.
image:doc/images/Debug_info.png[]
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1902[#1902] [sirius-web] Add new data fetchers to sirius-web allowing to execute AQL requests

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/593[#593] [domain] Add support for referencing and extending other custom domains
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1518[#1518] [project] Remove the "format all code" save action in order to let us write code without having to specify "@formatter:off" everywhere. It will also make it easier for us to use IDEs other than Eclipse to contribute to Sirius Web
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1632[#1632] [core] Start documenting the variables available for each operation in our various representations
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1565[1565] [view] The definition of the View DSL now uses richer data types for most attributes.
This has no visible effect at the moment, but will allow better documentation, validation and configuration later.
- [studio] Add a project template for the Papaya domains and view
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1667[#1667] [diagram] Make the contextual palette self contained 
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1858[#1858] [project] Improve project template cards layout
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1879[#1879] [core] Add an annotation `@Builder` to identify builders and simplify some use cases involving the builder pattern.
It is now possible to use builders in records and it is a first step toward the deprecation of the `@Immutable` annotation in favor of more records.
- [diagram] Added a common interface `IDiagramElement` that is implemented by `Node` and `Edge`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1904[#1904] [project] Add templates to track our work on shapes and scopes in `doc/iterations/YYYY-MM/{scopes/scope.adoc|shapes/shape.adoc}`.
At the end of every iteration, we will work on the shape of the new iterations and validate them by merging a first version.
+
During the iteration, while developers will progress on their work, they will update the scope.
We will not create a new commit for each minor change in the scope, instead the scope will evolve while a pull request is updated.
The progress on a task could thus be shared with a draft pull request with the rest of the team.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1615[#1615] [diagram] `DiagramDescription.getTools()` has been removed.
It was not actually used, as tools have long been found in `DiagramDescription.getToolSections()` instead.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1588[#1588] [project] Moved the action "New Model" and "Upload model" in a new tree toolbar
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1614[#1614] [graphql] Add a SuccessPayload to replace most basic payloads, add GQLWidgetOperationPayload to replace most basic Operation

=== Dependency update

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1377[#1377] [core] Switch to Java 17
- [backend] Switch to EMFJson 2.3.4
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1496[#1496] [layout] Switch to ELK 0.8.1

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1374[#1374] [layout] The border node position is now updated when its parents bounds has changed (e.g. when a node increases its size because of a child creation).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1580[#1580] [diagram] Border nodes do not return to their previous position after they have been moved manually.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1522[#1522] [diagram] Rectangle nodes with a header can now be resized.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1529[#1529] [diagram] Improve the layout of newly created edges with a begin or end label
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1607[#1607] [tree] Make sure that a recently closed representation can be opened again
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1686[#1686] [diagram] Fix SVG export of the wrapped labels
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1692[#1692] [core] JPEG images where previously ignored if using a `.jpg` extension instead of `.jpeg`.
They are now correctly supported
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1741[#1741] [diagram] Border node placement specified with ELK configuration not taken into account anymore
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1720[#1720] [diagram] Fix the position where newly created views appear on a diagram after a drop

=== New Features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1567[#1567] [project] Add support for project templates.
Project templates are defined in the backend using the `IProjectTemplateProvider` (template metadata) and `IProjectTemplateInitializer` (project contents) interfaces.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1456[#1456] [diagram] Add the ability to filter the edge created using some graphical variables
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1456[#1456] [view] Add a precondition expression to the edge description
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1463[#1463] [diagram] Add support for the direct edit of the start and end labels of an edge. Two new tools can be defined on an edge in order to specify how the begin and end labels can be edited.
+
image:doc/images/View_edit_begin_and_end_labels.png[width=491,height=285]
+
For each of those tools, `Edit Begin Label` and `Edit End Label` in the previous screenshot, the specifier can also enter an `Initial Direct Edit Label Expression` which will be used to compute the initial value of the label when the edition will be triggered.
This is mostly used to support the edition of computed labels.
The variables `semanticEdgeSource` and `semanticEdgeTarget` are now available both in the `Initial Direct Edit Label Expression` and while evaluating the behavior of the tools themselves.
+
image:doc/images/View_edit_begin_label_initial_expression.png[width=522,height=224]
+
In order to edit a begin or end label of an edge, it is necessary to double click on said label.
Using `F2`` will trigger the edition of the center label of the edge.
+
image:doc/images/View_edit_begin_label_in_action.png[width=550,height=234]
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1496[#1496] [layout] Add the support for free form compartment.
+
image:doc/images/Free_form_layout_in_a_list_layout.png[A node with three free form compartment]

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1624[#1624] [diagram] Add support for expand/collapse of nodes.
A node can be collapsed or expanded if its view description is collapsible or if its sirius desktop description is a region (Horizontal or Vertical stack).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1624[#1624] [diagram] The `collapsingState` of a node is now available as a variable to compute its style.
As a result, it is possible to create a conditional style which will use the collapsing state quite easily.
Using the view DSL, one can use the expression `aql:collapsingState.toString() = 'COLLAPSED'` as a condition to create a style which will be used when the node is collapsed.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1584[#1584] [diagram] Studio makers can indicate whether or not a node type can be resized by the end-user or not.
Nodes which can not be resized (or have not been resized yet) have their actual size computed from the NodeDescription's sizeProvider in a uniform way for all node types.
Nodes which can and *have* been resized keep their user-chosen size across both incremental and full layout (as long as the requested size is compatible with other constraints).

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1583[#1583] [diagram] Add support for diagram nodes labels' auto-wrap
+
image:doc/images/Diagram_node_labels_auto_wrap.png[width=517,height=424]
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1588[#1588] [tree] Add support for enabling/disabling the synchronization between the explorer and the current selection.
When it is enabled, if the current selection is not visible in the explorer, it will be revealed by expanding the relevant tree items.
On the other hand, when it is disabled, the selection will be visible in the explorer but no tree items will be automatically expanded.


=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1559[#1559] [view] It is now possible to specify the (computed) width and height separately for a _Node Style_ (instead of a single size before, which always resulted in square shapes).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1560[#1560] Remove unused `EditingContextCompletionProposalsDataFetcher`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1426[#1426] [view] Add missing data type on initialDirectEditLabelExpression
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1456[#1456] [diagram] Add new methods to the diagram rendering cache to compute the parent, ancestors, children and descendants of a given node identifier
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1574[#1574] [diagram] Single click tools can now be executed on Edges in addition to Nodes
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1569[#1569] [view] Only delegate semantic deletion to the element's _Delete Tool_
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1562[#1562] [view] The default/canonical behaviors for diagram elements can now be invoked explicitly from AQL expressions. See `org.eclipse.sirius.components.view.emf.CanonicalServices`. This feature will be used only for internal for now. There will be breaking changes on this topic soon.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1596[#1596] [diagram] Sirius Web now includes two example parametric SVG images named "Package" and "Class".
They can be used as any custom image (e.g. in a View-based diagram), but their precise shape is partially computed on the backend, in this case to adjust the size of the label compartment to the actual label's width.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1563[#1563] [view] If a diagram description does not explicitly configure a delete/direct edit/element creation tool, the corresponding behavior is simply disabled.
By default, new nodes, edges and tools are explicitly configured to invoke the default canonical behavior; it is just made explicit in the model and can now serve as a based or removed to disable the behavior.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1558[#1558] [diagram] When a diagram is read-only, the following actions are now disabled: _Arrange All_, _Reveal hidden_ and _Reveal faded_ elements, and triggering direct edit or delete from the keyboard.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1401[#1401] [tree] The setSelection is called even if the selection did not changed

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1482[#1482] [core] Allow CustomImageLoader to get images from packaged projects. To import images from local files on startup, set `-Dorg.eclipse.sirius.web.customImages.pattern="file:///local/path/to/folder/with/files/**"`. To import images from a folder inside a packaged JAR, use `-Dorg.eclipse.sirius.web.customImages.pattern="classpath:path/in/jar/**"`. The syntax supports Ant-style path patterns.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1517[#1517] [core] Remove the error for strings which are not marked as non-externalized

These images can be displayed in forms using the new image widget, or in View-based diagrams using and ImageNodeStyleDescription and selecting the image in the list of available shapes.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1457[#1457] [diagram] Make possible to provide an expression on the label edit tool in View DSL to initialize the direct edit label text field. We kept the current behavior for the compatibility layer but, _in fine_ it will be possible to leverage the direct edit tool _Input Label Expression_ to initialize the direct edit label text field.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1346[#1346] [form] Add support for a Rich Text edition widget. The widget behaves in a similar way to the existing Textfield and Textarea widgets, except that the text value should be valid Markdown, and can be edited in a WYSIWYG way by the end user.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1428[#1428] [layout] Add support for List layout compartment. We rely on the layout strategy engine handler switch and the layout engine handler switch to dispatch to the correct behavior depending on how children should be laid out and the type of the node. This kind of architecture has already been implemented for model operation for the View DSL. Nothing has changed if nodes have to be laid out freely.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1439[#1439] [form] Add support for toolbar actions in Form/FormDescriptionEditor
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1437[#1437] [form] Add support for styles preview in FormDescriptionEditor

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1064[#1064] [core] Remove the URL utility file and ask for the `httpOrigin` instead. Consumers of Sirius Components which rely on the behavior of the URL utility file should instead maintain their own utility file since it is dependent on our build technology and development process.

=== Dependency update

- [backend] Switch to EMFJson 2.3.2-SNAPSHOT. It contains better management of proxy resolution in case of intermodel references

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1368[#1368] [diagram] Do not render rectangle view children twice

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/780[#780] [diagram] Add support for edge reconnection. Edge reconnection descriptions can be defined either inside a classical Sirius desktop VSM or, using the View DSL. While using the Sirius desktop VSM you can define a tool to do both target and source reconnection, you will need to define a tool to reconnect the source and another one to reconnect the target using the View DSL

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-067] Add support for injecting platform services/beans into Java service classes used by studios
- [ADR-068] Improve support for precondition expression from representation description

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1311[#1311] [releng] Allow reusing `sirius-components-emf` without dependencies to the domain or view DSL. As a result, two new projects `sirius-components-domain-emf` and `sirius-components-view-emf` have been introduced in order to connect the EMF compatibility layer with the domain and view DSL. Consumers of `sirius-components-emf` may have to update their import. The behavior of the code has not been modified
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1311[#1311] [releng] Allow reusing `sirius-component-emf` without dependencies to Sirius Desktop. As a result, a new project `sirius-components-compatibility-emf` has been added in order to provide EMF support for the Sirius desktop compatibility layer. Consumers of `sirius-components-emf` may have to update their import. The behavior of the code has not been modified
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1237[#1237] [releng] Remove the two hardcoded dependencies to Spring MVC from Sirius Components. As such, reusing most components from Sirius Components without Spring MVC will be easier. The only projects with a dependency to Spring MVC are located in the `web` package
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1312[#1312] [graphql] Provide the datafetchers used by the representations. Starting with the validation representation, we will provide datafetchers directly in Sirius Components to simplify the integration of Sirius Components in various applications. The project `sirius-components-graphql-utils` has been merged into `sirius-components-graphql-api` since they had similar dependencies.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [charts] The components related to charts have been extracted to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-charts`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [form] The components related to forms have been extracted to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-forms`. The views and representations have adopted the suffix `View` and `Representation` respectively. As an example, the component `FormWebSocketContainer` is now named `FormRepresentation`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [formdescriptioneditors] The components related to formdescriptioneditors have been extracted to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-formdescriptioneditors`. The representation has been renamed `FormDescriptionEditorRepresentation`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [core] Since the core parts of Sirius Components cannot possibly known the components of the representations installed in a project, the context `RepresentationContext` will not provide a default value anymore. In a similar fashion, the `ServerContext` from `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-core` will now be required in order to let Sirius Components retrieve the URL of the backend.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [tree] The trees related components and the explorer have been extracted to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-trees`. The `ExplorerWebSocketContainer` has also been renamed `ExplorerView` to match the naming convention of the other views. The components migrated have also been fully converted to XState and MaterialUI
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [workbench] The workbench was depending on some tree components in order to compute the list of `TreeItemContextMenuContribution` to use in the explorer. This dependency has been removed and as a result, users of the workbench component will have to rely on the `TreeItemContextMenuContext` to provide the contributions
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [workbench] Move the workbench related code to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-core`. This move includes components such as `Workbench`, `RepresentationContext`, `WorkbenchViewContribution` for example
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [diagram] Move the code of the diagram and the selection wizard in the packages `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-diagrams` and `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-selection`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [core] Some code remain in the soon to be deprecated Sirius Component package `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components`. Most of this code will either be moved to Sirius Web or be removed entirely (such as the old non MaterialUI widgets)
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1288[#1288] [core] The `EditingContext#representationDescriptions` field now takes an `objectId: ID` as argument instead of just the object's `kind: ID`.
This allows representation precondition expressions to be more precise as they know the actual candidate instance, not just its type.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1281[#1281] [form] The `LinkDescription` now requires a `displayProvider` and a `styleProvider`. The `displayProvider` is used to display the text of the hyperLink.
The GraphQL API has also been changed with two additional fields on the type `Link`: `display` and `style` (optional). The front-end use the `display` value instead of the `label` value to display the hyperlink text.
The `label` value is displayed before the widget to be consistent with other properties sections.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1320[#1320] [diagram] The `selectedNode` variable is now always _defined_ in the context of drop handlers and single-click tools. Previously, if the target of the drop or single-click tool was the diagram itself (instead of a node), the variable was not defined at all. Now it is defined but `null` in these cases.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1289[#1289] [core] The `representationDescriptions` GraphQL query now returns a new attribute named `defaultName` in addition to the `label` and `id`. For view-based representations and , the `defaultName` is computed from the `RepresentationDescription`'s `titleExpression`.

=== Dependency update

- [frontend] Update the format of the `package-lock.json` by moving to node 18.7.0 and npm 8.15.0. This will allow us to use the latest version of npm which comes with improvements for its workspace support. This will also help us move beyond the change in behavior of https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4998[node 16.15.1 and npm 8.6]
- [frontend] Update the version of `jest-transform-css` used in order to fix the long standing issues of its incompatibility with the version of `postcss`` that we use. We will thus use `postcss 8.4.14` and `jest-transform-css 4.0.1` now
- [frontend] Remove our dependency to `ts-transform-graphql-tag` since it is not maintained and its dependencies are outdated and since it is used to lower the dependency with `graphql-tag` which we will stop using soon
- [frontend] Remove the peer dependency to `graphql-tag`. It will not be required for projects consuming Sirius Components now
- [frontend] Remove the peer dependency to `subscriptions-transport-ws`. It is not required by Sirius Components and consumers of Sirius Components will be free to switch to `graphql-ws` instead of even to not rely on web socket at all to communicate with the backend. Sirius Components itself does not need to specify how the communication with the backend will be done
- [frontend] Switch to `@apollo/client 3.6.9`, `@material-ui/core 4.12.4`, `@material-ui/icons 4.11.3`, `graphql 16.5.0`, `prop-types 15.8.1`, `sprotty 0.12.2` and `xstate 4.32.1`. Various development dependencies have also been updated such as typescript, rollup, prettier etc
- [backend] Switch to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.7.2[Spring Boot 2.7.2]
- [backend] Switch to the managed version of GraphQL Java, as of Spring Boot 2.7.2, we will thus use GraphQL Java 18.2

== v2022.7.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-60] Add support for d3 bars data-structure and bar-chart representation
- [ADR-61] Add support for flexbox containers on form description
- [ADR-62] Switch to a monorepo layout
- [ADR-63] Simplify the Sprotty integration
- [ADR-64] Add support for a ToggableAreaContainer in forms
- [ADR-65] Add support for a tree widget in forms
- [ADR-66] Add a new "Related Elements" view

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1141[#1141] [frontend] The `PropertiesWebSocketContainer` which was hard-coded to display the `propertiesEvent` subscription has been made more generic and renamed `FormBasedView`.
It now takes an additional prop named `subscriptionName` so that it can be bound to other subscriptions (which must follow the same API/protocol and send Form payloads).
To integrate the "Details" view inside a workbench, one must now use the new `DetailsView` component (which simply configures `FormBasedView` to listen to `propertiesEvent` as before).

=== Dependency update

- The frontend now depends on `@material-ui/lab` to support the new https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1139[tree widget] (see ADR-065).

=== Bug fixes

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1242[#1242] [view] Provide icons for View DSL Widgets and FormDescription
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1214[#1214] [form] The mandatory label attribute which was available in all concrete widget types is now explicitly part of the common supertype.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1215[#1215] [form] Widgets can now optionally specify an `iconURL`. It is not used in the default UI for the details view or forms representations for now, but icons (if present) are visible in the toggle buttons bar for groups using the new `displayMode = TOGGLEABLE_AREAS`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1141[#1141] [workbench] It is now possible to add a "Related View" contribution to the workbench.
It behaves like the "Details" view in that it reacts to the selection by displaying a Form, but is designed to display contextual information about the selected element (i.e. which elements it points to and which elements point to it for example).
The actual definition of the application (e.g. Sirius Web), which must provide a single bean implementing the new `IRelatedElementsDescriptionProvider` interface.

=== Deprecation warning

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1088[#1088] [core] Change the type of `IRepresentationDescription#id` from UUID to String.
This will allow us, when we will receive an operation to perform with a given representation description identifier, to determine if this operation should be handled by the Sirius Desktop compatibility layer, the View support or by a programmatic API
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1138[#1138] [workbench] The APIs for the `Panels` and `Site` components have been modified to support closing/opening the panels.
In particular, `Panels` now handles all three parts of the layout (the left and right sites and the main area) directly instead of using recursive two-sided panels.
See ADR-54 for the details.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1155[#1155] [workbench] `WorkbenchViewContribution` now require an `icon` prop
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1155[#1155] [core] The palette used by Sirius Components now require two additional colors for the navigation area. The type of the new palette is described in `frontend/src/materialui.ts`. Users of the fallback theme can upgrade without having to add those new colors since they are provided by default.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/966[#966] [core] The source and target edge anchor are not considered as routing points anymore. Edges of old diagrams may have unexpected behavior since new edges will have two less routing points than existing edges in old diagrams. For further explanation see ADR-054.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1180[#1180] [diagram] An implementation of `IConnectorToolsProvider` has to be made for the connector tool to work.

=== Dependency update

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1118[#1118] [core] Switch to Spring Boot 2.6.6

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1140[#1140] [form] The frontend now depends on `@material-ui/lab` version 4.0.0-alpha.61

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1154[#1154] [diagram] Display the palette where the click has been made, not where the cursor is. With the edge animation it was possible for the palette to be displayed at a wrong position which was making possible to create a floating edge.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1148[#1148] [diagram] Fix a lot of cases where removing an edge will change the layout of some other edges. This behavior will still happen when it will exist two edges between the two same elements and one of the edge is removed, the other edge will probably take the layout of the removed edge.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1176[#1176] [diagram] Fix potential ConcurrentModificationException in ViewDiagramDescriptionConverter when manipulating diagrams. This bug was introduced by the https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1152[#1152].

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/966[#966] [diagram] Add the support source and target edge position ratio on the frontend side. For further explanation see ADR-055.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1179[#1179] [core] Move `WorkbenchSelection` and `WorkbenchSelectionEntry` to `sirius-components-representations` in order to let any representation use those classes. We may rename the `Selection` representation in the future in order to rename them to `Selection` and `SelectionEntry` to align the frontend and backend API
- [releng] Detect the presence of classes without a public visibility or with a package or protected constructor in order to speed up the code reviews.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1138[#1138] [workbench] The left and right panels can be closed by clicking on the current view's icon or by resizing them to the minimum width (showing only the icons).
When closed, clicking on any of the views' icon will re-open the panel to make the selected view visible.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/689[#689] [diagram] Add a variable containing objects ids to render for unsynchronized nodes rendering

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1117[#1117] [diagram] Add support for multiple selections in a diagram. This work only display the various selection entries in the diagram. It does not support Ctrl+click or ⌘+click in a diagram. Support for this feature would require additional work with major improvements in the lifecycle of the `DiagramServer``

== v2022.3.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-039] Provide a variable to detect the environment
- [ADR-040] Add support for a post selection
- [ADR-041] Add the ability to contribute additional services to the EMFQueryService
- [ADR-042] Use wildcard collections instead of List<Object> in Providers

- [ADR-047] Add support for tools preconditions
- [ADR-048] Rename concepts related to tools
- [ADR-049] Improve the incremental layout for dropper elements

=== Deprecation warning
- [core] The various DTOs related to the creation and renaming of both documents and representations will be removed from the project at some point. The only reason why we will keep them for the moment is that some of them are used to trigger some specific behavior in the `EditingContextEventProcessor`. The split of the representation metadata should help us remove those special use cases
- [core] The method `IRepresentationMetadataSearchService#findByRepresentation` will be deleted in the future, it only exists as a transition from requesting the whole content of a representation every time to requesting only its metadata when it's necessary
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/779[#779] [diagram] The properties `DiagramDescription#toolSections` should be removed in the near future since it has no real reason to exist now that the tools are computed on the fly. On top of that, `ITool.handler` will also be deleted at the same time since we no longer need to create the handlers of all the tools while the server is starting
- [diagram] The GraphQL mutations `deleteFromDiagram` will stop being used soon by the delete from model and delete from diagram tools. They will instead be considered as regular tools and thus leverage the "invoke tool" GraphQL API

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/808[#808] [core] Update the namespace of the projects from `sirius-web-xxx` to `sirius-components-xxx`. The projects `sirius-web-api` and `sirius-web-core-api` have been merged into `sirius-components-core` since there was no difference in scope between both projects and neither of them was strictly limited to an api. Since we have validated that most of our projects can be reused outside of a Spring environment (i.e. an environment where Spring Frameworks is in charge of the ApplicationContext), we have also removed the `-spring-` from most of our project names. We already had Spring dependencies outside of those `-spring-` projects anyway.
- [core] Switch to the `org.eclipse.sirius` groupId in order to prepare for a future publication of our backend on maven central
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/808[#808] [core] Update the namespace of the packages from `org.eclipse.sirius.web.xxx` to `org.eclipse.sirius.components.xxx`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/998[#998] [core] Remove the various annotations used to support a code-first approach to build the GraphQL schema
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/975[#975] [core] Remove useless parts of the GraphQL API which were both unused by the Sirius Components frontend and not handled by the Sirius Components backend
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/959[#959] [diagram] Remove the concept of `DeleteTool`. This concept was not useful since any tool can perform a deletion
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1018[#1018] [core] Remove the default implementation of `IRepresentationMetadataSearchService` since products integrating Sirius Components needs the ability to customize its behavior
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1019[#1019] [core] Services now have access to the context of the request triggering their execution. Consumer of Sirius Components will have to provide the `RequestAttributes`` in the `RequestContextHolder`` to make the `EditingContextEventProcessor`` work. It should be very easy for those in a Spring environment, but it is not automatic for those outside of a Spring environment
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/699[#699] [core] The `IRepresentationImageProvider` will now use the `kind` of the representation instead of the instance to compute the image. It will allow users to ask for the image of a representation with either its instance or its metadata
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/699[#699] [core] Add the `targetObjectId` to the `RepresentationMetadata`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1045[#1045] [core] Providers will now return List<?> instead of List<Object>. This makes it possible for applications to reuse existing services to implement providers without making useless copies of lists
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1068[#1068] [form] The form representation is now supporting multiple elements as an input
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1068[#1068] [workbench] The integration of the details view in the workbench is not limited to semantic objects with a kind starting with `siriusComponents://semantic`. Any object can be used as the input of the details view and we will now provide the identifier of all the objects in the selection. This may include graphical elements such as nodes, edges, representations or anything selected in the explorer for example
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/693[#693] [workbench] The workbench non longer hard-codes the views which are visible in the left and right side-panels. Instead, each application must explicitly configure its workbench using the new `WorkbenchViewContribution` element. See ADR-046 for more details. As part of this change, the `ExplorerWebSocketContainerProps`, `PropertiesWebSocketContainerProps`, `RepresentationsWebSocketContainerProps` and `ValidationWebSocketContainer` types have been removed and replaced with the single `WorkbenchViewComponentProps` type which is structurally equivalent.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/779[#779] [diagram] Change the signature of the GraphQL API used to retrieve the tools of the diagram's contextual palette in order to include the identifier of the diagram element
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1022[#1022] [diagram] The `NodeCreationEvent` and the `EdgeCreationEvent` have been renamed to `SinglePositionEvent` and `DoublePositionEvent` to distinguish from any imagined behavior. Additional tests of the incremental layout should be added in the future to test its behavior in use cases that we did not consider in the past. The `CreateNodeTool` and `CreateEdgeTool` have also been renamed in order to describe how the user interact with them instead of the behavior that we imagine they have. Their associated mutations have also been renamed. See the ADR for additional details

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/956[#956] [diagram] Add the border node concept on front-end and implement the border node snap. The user can move the border node only on the side of its parent node. The border node enters its parent node with 8px. The ELK automatic layout is adapted to have the same behavior.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1081[#1081] [workbench] It is now possible to specify the component to display in the main area when no representation is open instead of the `OnboardArea` (which is still the default when there is no override)
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1070[#1070] [explorer] When selecting an element or opening a representation (for example from its URL or from the onboard area), it is automatically made visible and selected in the explorer.

- [ADR-38] Improve the layout of multiple edges between the same nodes

=== Deprecation warning
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/858[#858] [core] Our dependency to Spring Security will be reduced or eliminated soon. Sirius Components will now longer have any opinion on matters of authentication, authorization, principal management, etc. All those concerns will be out of the scope of the project. It will also be way easier to integrate Sirius Components in a Spring based application since it won't come with this additional requirement

=== Breaking changes
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/858[#858] [core] Remove most of the methods of `ISubscriptionManager` since they were not really useful
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/871[#871] [core] Change the constructor of the `EditingContextEventProcessor` in order to let consumers provide an `IEditingContextEventProcessorExecutorServiceProvider`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/134[#134] [workbench] Switch from a single-selection API to a multi-selection API with some changes to the `Selection` object of the workbench
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/878[#878] [core] As specified in the ADR-36, the kind of an object (representation, semantic elements, selection entry of the workbench) is now an URI. All previous kind values have been modified
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/878[#878] [graphql] The GraphQL argument `classId` which appeared on some fields has been replaced by `kind` since it was always the `kind` of an object. Technically, it is always the kind of a semantic element but that may not be the case forever
- [core] `IEditService.findClass()` has been removed
- [core] `IRepresentationDescriptionSearchService` has a new `findAll` method to return all the representation descriptions available in a given editing context
- [core] The package containing the concepts related to the editing context has been renamed to remove references to the project
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/932[#932] [graphql] Introduce the RepresentationMetadata concept in order to prepare the separation of the metadata from the representation

- [diagram] Remove the ToolSeparator components.

=== Dependency update

- [core] Switch to Spring Boot 2.6.1
- [core] Switch to GraphQL Java 17.3
- [compatibility] Switch to Sirius Desktop 6.6.0
- [frontend] Switch to @xstate/react 1.6.3
- [frontend] Switch to typescript 4.5.4
- [frontend] Switch to @typescript-eslint/parser 5.7.0
- [frontend] Switch to xstate 4.26.1
- [frontend] Update various development dependencies such as Rollup, ESLint, Prettier and Jest

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/726[#726] [view] Nodes can now have a dynamically computed size (using `sizeComputationExpression`) which depends on the current state of the semantic model.
If the expression is present and produces a positive integer, it will be used as both the width and height of the node, in pixels.
Currently it is not possible to compute different values for width and height.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/133[#133] [diagram] Add a connector tool to help create edges in diagrams
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/596[#596] [view] It is now possible to define border nodes in dynamic diagram definitions

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/822[#822] [diagram] Add support for graphical deletion. We can now offer a dedicated menu in the user interface to perform a graphical deletion instead of a semantic one. On the backend, the compatibility layer has been updated to perform a `DeletionViewRequest` if there is no default deletion tool and a new variable named `deletionPolicy` is available to determine if the deletion should be performed graphically or semantically
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/943[#943] [view] Add support for optional begin & end labels on edges in views
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/822[#822] [view] Handle 'Delete from Diagram' in view-based diagrams

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/871[#871] [core] An `IEditingContextEventProcessorExecutorServiceProvider` can be given to the `EditingContextEventProcessor` in order to customize the `ExecutorService` which will be used to handle the processing of the `IInput` received. This will allow consumers to change the thread management policy of Sirius Components
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/134[#134] [workbench] The internal API of the workbench is now ready to accept features leveraging a multi-selection
- [form] Add a tooltip to always make the full label available
- [core] Customize the Spring `ObjectMapper` instead of creating a brand new one from scratch in our `ObjectMapperConfiguration`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/896[#896] [diagram] Allow to make specific changes before and after the layout
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/897[#897] [compatibility] The Bordered Node Dot Style is now handled in the compatibility layer

== v2021.12.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-032] Relax our ID policy for editing context and representation (update)
- [ADR-034] Switch from semver to calver
- [ADR-035] Use a common pattern for configuration properties
- [ADR-036] Adopt a more structured selection

=== Deprecation warning

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/818[#818] [workbench] The concept of `Selection` will be restructured, as described in the ADR-036. Every part of the code involved in the manipulation of the selection of the workbench will be impacted. This includes concepts as remote as the representation descriptions which are used to computed fields like `kind`. For example, the behavior of the `TreeDescription#getKindProvider` and `NodeDescription#getTargetObjectKindProvider` will have to be updated for all the providers. Failure to update to the new behavior will make the selection fail in the workbench
- [core] The Success parameterless constructor will be removed soon.

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/804[#804] [core] Update the name of our configuration properties. The configuration property `sirius.web.graphql.websocket.allowed.origins` will now be `sirius.components.cors.allowedOriginPatterns` and it will support complex patterns on top of regular origins. The default value will be restored to nothing since it has temporarily been set to `*`. In a development environment, the recommended value would be both patterns `https://localhost:[*]` and `http://localhost:[*]` in order to accept requests from any application hosted on the same machine. The configuration property `org.eclipse.sirius.web.editingContextEventProcessorRegistry.disposeDelay` will now be `sirius.components.editingContext.disposeDelay`. Its default value will be 1s since it is the only realistic option with domain and view support.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/692[#692] [explorer] The explorer view is now more generic and extensible. It can represent arbitrary kinds of tree items, but the tree items supported must be configured for each application.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/700[#700] [core] editingContextId and representationId are no longer UUID but String. Products that rely on sirius-components will be able to have their own ID policy for the editingContextId and representationId.

=== Dependency update

- [core] Switch to Spring Boot 2.5.6

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/773[#773] [compatibility] Add support for both `createView` and `deleteView` model operations which can be used to support unsynchronized diagrams from Sirius Desktop.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/694[#694] [core] Add `IRepresentationRefreshPolicyRegistry` to contribute `IRepresentationRefreshPolicyProvider`s in order to customize on which kind of change description, representations will be refreshed.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/613[#613] [compatibility] Add support for external java action with the new API `IExternalJavaActionProvider` which allows others to provide instances of `IExternalJavaAction` in order to perform some custom behavior during the execution of a tool for example.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/154[#154] [diagram] Add support for the edition of the label of an edge

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/799[#799] [diagram] The buttons in the diagram's toolbar now have proper tooltips
- [core] Add a task to display TypeScript errors in the VS Code problems view
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/773[#773] [compatibility] The synchronization policy of the node descriptions is now properly computed from the `AbstractNodeMapping`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/694[#694] [core] Data can be provided to Success in order to notify changement made by operation made on the editing context.
- [explorer] The context menus on explorer items has been migrated to Material UI
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/692[#692] [tree] The tree representation will now act as a proper representation. Its event handlers will now be implementations of  `ITreeEventHandler` and its input will be implementations of `ITreeInput`
- [diagram] The variable `selectedNode` is now available even if there are no `selectedObject` from a selection representation
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/817[#817] [core] Improve the TypeScript typing of the frontend
- [form] Add support for property groups defined in a different category

=== Bug fixes

- [diagram] The variable `selectedNode` was only available in the variable manager used when executing node tools if a selection dialog was also available. Now the `selectedNode` variable will always be available unless the tool has been invoked on the background of the diagram

== v0.5.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-024] Add support for view deletion requests
- [ADR-025] Switch to a schema first approach for our GraphQL schema
- [ADR-026] Improve the performance of unsynchronized nodes
- [ADR-027] Make the explorer independent from modeling concepts
- [ADR-028] Move representations out of the explorer
- [ADR-029] Introduce some object services
- [ADR-030] Add a link representation
- [ADR-031] Separate metadata representations
- [ADR-032] Relax our constraints on some of our identifiers
- [ADR-033] Add support for unsynchronized tools

=== Deprecation warning

- [core] The field `ChangeKind#NOTHING` will be removed soon since we have the option to just not send anything at all
- [explorer] Representations will be removed from the explorer soon
- [core] The metadata of the representations will be removed from the content of the representation soon. As a result, fields like `IRepresentation#id`, `IRepresentation#descriptionId` or event `IRepresentation#label` will be removed. It will allow us to massively improve the performance of some use cases and simplify the manipulation of the representations in other use cases
- [workbench] The workbench will become independent of internal concepts from Sirius Components. As a result, the explorer will not have any hardcoded actions such as "create a new document" or "create a new representation". The concept of document will be removed from the frontend entirely
- [graphql] The interface `ITypeProvider` will soon be removed
- [graphql] All the GraphQL annotations used to build the schema programmatically will be removed soon such as `@GraphQLObjectType`, `@GraphQLField`, `@GraphQLNonNull`, `@GraphQLID`. Annotations used to execute GraphQL queries like `@QueryDataFetcher` or `@MutationDataFetcher` will still be supported

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/673[#673] [graphql] Rename namespace to domain in the GraphQL API
- [core] Remove the need to give a logger to the `BaseRender`
- [properties] Remove useless fields from the properties payloads
- [graphql] Use pagination for the fields used by the onboarding such as `EditingContext#stereotypeDescriptions` or `EditingContext#representations`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/563[#563] [core] Update the support for custom images by referencing images by their identifiers instead of their file name
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/683[#683] [core] Move projects such as `sirius-web-services-api`, `sirius-web-services`, `sirius-web-graphql-schema` and `sirius-web-graphql` out of Sirius Components
- [core] Remove all the `sirius-web-collaborative-XXX-api` projects. Those projects became a random collection of all the interfaces (external APIs and internal ones) used by the collaborative projects. Those interfaces now exist within the various collaborative projects
- [graphql] Remove the field `ErrorPayload#additionalMessages` since it was useless
- [graphql] Remove the principal from the GraphQL `Context` since Spring Security allows us to access it much more easily
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/744[#744] [core] Use Reactor to communicate event handler results. As a result of this change, the concept of `EventHandlerResponse` has been removed and replaced with two different sinks. The `payloadSink` should be used to communicate a response to the process which has sent the input to handler. The `changeDescriptionSink` can be used in order to indicate to the other event processors a change that has occur. Such change may trigger a refresh or other behavior in the other event processors
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/727[#727] [core] Make `IRepresentationDescriptionSearchService` editing context aware
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/750[#750] [core] Add the ability to provide a status error message. The enumeration `Status` has been replaced by an interface named `IStatus` with two classes implementing it, `Failure` and `Success`. Thanks to `Failure`, it is now possible to provide a custom error message for an event handler but as of today this error message is not used in the `ErrorPayload` created from the `Failure`. This will change in the future
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/740[#740] [domain] Remove the explicit `nsURI` from domain definitions. Now only a name will be required and other properties will be computed from said name (`nsURI` and `nsPrefix`).

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/190[#190] [emf] Add support for inverse references navigation thanks to an `ECrossReferenceAdapter` installed directly on the `EditingContext`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/588[#588] [domain] Add support for multiple inheritance
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/598[#598] [view] Add support for node border size, edge width, label font format and node label color in the view language
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/514[#514] [diagram] Disable move, resize and arrange all on auto-layout diagram
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/688[#688] [core] Add support for cross site request forgery token while uploading files. Projects integrating Sirius Components will have to decide whether or not they want to add such support and if they want to activate it. It will not be supported for now in Sirius Web
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/671[#671] [graphql] Add the GraphQL schemas of Sirius Components. Starting with this commit, projects integrating Sirius Components will be able to easily embrace a schema first approach to build their GraphQL schema. It will also be way easier to track changes to our GraphQL schema over time
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/697[#697] [graphql] Add the ability to perform AQL based queries on the content of an editing context using the `queryBasedXxx` fields
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/672[#672] [diagram] Add support for the `ViewDeletionRequest` in a similar fashion as the previously added `ViewCreationRequest` in order to support unsynchronized diagram description created programmatically

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/719[#719] [compatibility] Add support for the `container` and `element` variables for the node/container creation tools
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/729[#729] [emf] Make sure that the resource set of our `EditingContext` is an `IEditingDomainProvider`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/731[#731] [view] Allow an `EdgeDescription` to have multiple sources and targets
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/743[#743] [view] Add support for edge labels in views

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/654[#654] [domain] Set `Feature#optional` default value to `true` since `false` created serialization issues. We cannot provide `false` as a default value since EMF cannot handle such use case
- [diagram] Make the `DiagramRenderingCache` maps predictable in order to improve performances
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/735[#735] [view] Ensure that the generic edge tool is not used when a custom one is provided

- [core] Add a fallback strategy to the payload sink. With the use of reactor to the event handler, it has become possible to handle an input without ever providing a payload as a response. Now after 5s without a response, an `ErrorPayload` will be send back. This will not stop the current processing of the input nor will it rollback any change made, it will only send a response to ensure that the frontend is not waiting forever for an answer
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/776[#776] [view] Avoid id collision between diagram descriptions with the same name by leveraging the URI of the diagram description to create a more unique identifier


== v0.4.0 (2021-07-30)

This new release improves support for meta modeling.
It also prepares the removal of a lot of code from this repository.
Sirius Components will soon be independent from any persistence layer, from the GraphQL layer and even from a specific business layer.

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-020] Add support for validation in the workbench
- [ADR-021] Add validation support to forms
- [ADR-022] Add support for selection dialog
- [ADR-023] Move business code from Sirius Components to Sirius Web

=== Deprecation warning

- [core] All the GraphQL and business related projects will be move to the Sirius Web project. As a result, projects such as `sirius-web-services-api`, `sirius-web-services`, `sirius-web-graphql-schema` and `sirius-web-graphql` will no longer exist in this repository

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/569[#569] [emf] Move document-related code out of `sirius-web-emf`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/569[#569] [core] Remove the last dependency to `sirius-web-services` from `sirius-web-emf`. As a result, the `ObjectService` does not need to know about representations anymore

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/562[#562] [core] Remove multiple references to `projectId` from the collaborative parts. This will impact various concepts such as the input used to edit forms
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/584[#584] [graphql] Remove all the GraphQL projects from `sirius-web-spring-starter`. As such, projects consuming Sirius Components will now have to explicitly depend to those projects. They will soon be removed entirely from Sirius Components to go Sirius Web
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/584[#584] [core] Remove the need to perform some access control and remove the `IDataFetcherEnvironmentService` in favor of `ObjectMapper`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/589[#589] [core] Remove `sirius-web-services` from `sirius-web-spring-starter`. Our business layer will soon be moved out of Sirius Components to Sirius Web
- [core] Remove the unused `ProjectCreatedEvent`
- [core] Remove the support for modelers since it has never been used
- [core] Refactor the collaborative layer in order to make it easier to reuse in other applications. This change includes a large set of small API breaks to concepts such as `IRepresentationService` or `IRepresentationSearchService`
- [core] Provide the editing context while searching and saving representations instead of its identifier. As a result, interfaces such as `IRepresentationPersistenceService` and `IRepresentationSearchService` have been modified

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/554[#554] [core] Add support for the validation view
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/428[#428] [properties] Add support for the edition of multi-valued references in the properties view

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/550[#550] [diagram] Improve the incremental layout support by taking into account the padding defined in the ELK configuration. On top of that some improvements have been made to the algorithm of the incremental layout in order to maintain it more easily
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/640[#640] [core] Use accordions to layout the left and right sites of the workbench

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/604[#604] [core] Use the MaterialUI `ClickAwayListener` to close the context menu. This help fix an issue where the context menu of the explorer could be closed automatically after being opened

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/451[#451] [diagram] Fix the issue which caused one character to be swallowed during the direct edit of a label in a diagram

== v0.3.0 (2021-05-18)

In this third major release, we have introduced support for the meta modeling in the web browser with the new domain and view languages.

In order to make Sirius Components even more reusable, we have removed all of the views of the frontend.
Sirius Components will no longer have an opinion on the architecture of the whole frontend application which will include the workbench.
It will only provide as frontend components, representations, the workbench and some utility components but not the core structure of a full web application.

On the backend side, things are moving in the same direction with some massive refactoring for the future removal of the persistence layer and the business layer from Sirius Components.
All the related projects will soon move to Sirius Web in order to integrate more easily Sirius Components in applications which do not share the same architectural constraints as Sirius Web.

Some improvements have also been made to the incremental layout in order to support a basic workflow.


=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-011] Decouple the event handlers from the refresh
- [ADR-012] Incremental layout: Make it possible to move or create a diagram element at a specific position
- [ADR-013] Refactor incremental layout
- [ADR-014] Add a correlation identifier to inputs and payloads
- [ADR-015] Add support for resizing diagram elements
- [ADR-016] Remove SubscriptionDescription
- [ADR-017] Improve the source and target edge anchors
- [ADR-018] Adopt a subset of Ecore to define data schemas for modelers
- [ADR-019] Support Simple Diagram Definitions by Reusing Sirius Desktop VSMs

=== Deprecation warning

- [core] All the business code will be removed from Sirius Components in the months to come (project, document, persistence-related code, etc). This will include projects such as `sirius-web-persistence`, `sirius-web-services-api` and more
- [core] The support for custom images has been integrated as a prototype. Massive changes to its API will occur in the future in order to cleanup its lifecycle
- [core] The concept `IDataFetchingEnvironmentService` which can be used to setup an access control policy will soon be removed since it will be up to each application to define its own policy

=== Breaking changes

- [core] Make views handle the lifecycle of their navbar instead of relying on a common navbar design and lifecycle. This will lower the complexity of the lifecycle of the views and give way more flexibility to the views
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/342[#342] [core] Introduce the `ChangeKind` concept to decouple event handlers from representation. Prior to this change, an event handler had to know the behavior of all the representations in order to find out which representations were impacted by its change. Now, it can describe the change made and each representation can find out if this change is relevant to them or not
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/348[#348] [core] Add a correlation identifier on `IInput` and `IPayload`. From now on all payloads created must have, as an identifier, the identifier of the input which has trigger their creation. This will give us the ability to provide advanced features in the future and improve our debugging capabilities now
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/351[#351] [core] Transform `ChangeKind` into `ChangeDescription` in order to encapsulate the source of the change too. This will allow a representation to distinguish between a `SEMANTIC_CHANGE` coming from another representation and one coming from itself
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/347[#347] [diagram] Replace `Size` and `Position` builders by `Size#of` and `Position#at`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/378[#378] [core] Make the stereotype description editing context aware. As a result, the `IStereotypeService` and some related classes are now manipulating an extra parameter in some methods, the `editingContextId`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/368[#368] [core] Remove the now useless `PreDestroyPayload`
- [properties] Remove the `PropertiesEventProcessor` which has never been used. Both the properties and the form representation are using the `FormEventProcessor`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/357[#357] [core] Remove the `SubscriptionDescription` and use instead the Spring `SecurityContextHolder` to retrieve the user subscribing to a reactive flux. As a result, this change will give us the ability to use much more easily other GraphQL integration in Spring such as Netflix DGS
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/268[#268] [core] Dispose instances of `IEditingContextEventProcessor` when they are not used anymore. This change introduce some minor evolutions to the API of `IDisposablePublisher` and `IEditingContextEventProcessorRegistry` which can impact any custom `IRepresentationEventProcessor`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/377[#377] [graphql] Rename the `projectEvent` subscription to `editingContextEvent`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/382[#382] [diagram] Switch the type of the label identifier from `String` to `UUID`

- [core] Remove the now useless `Subscriber` component
- [compatibility] Remove the now useless `CanCreateMappingTester` and `ToolDescriptionQuery`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/386[#386] [graphql] Make the representation creation editing context aware. This will move the field `representationDescriptions` on the editing context in the GraphQL schema
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/333[#333] [core] Make `IEditService#findClass` editing context aware
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/402[#402] [core] Remove all views from Sirius Components. Sirius Components will stop trying to provide a complete product but it will instead be used as a framework which can be used to build collaborative graphical applications. As a result, the views have been removed and most of them been transferred to Sirius Web.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/473[#473] [explorer] Improve the support for the read only workbench. This change introduce some API changes in several key workbench components such as `PropertiesWebSocketContainer`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/449[#449] [core] Move the navigation bar to MaterialUI. This change also removes the `LoggedInNavbar` and introduces the `NavigationBar`
- [core] Remove the now useless components such as `Navbar`, `ErrorView`, `View`, `Go`, `UserStatus` and `Footer`
- [core] Remove the now useless hooks such as `useCapabilities`, `useBranding`, `useAuth`

== v0.2.0 (2021-02-12)

Second major release of Sirius Components after the move to an open source project.

Sirius Components was the core part of the proprietary product Obeo Cloud Platform up until a couple months ago.
We have transferred in the Eclipse Foundation most of the code of Obeo Cloud Platform to become both Sirius Web and its core part Sirius Components which should be reusable in multiple applications.

In this release, we have made some major refactoring in order to separate some remaining business concern which are specific to Sirius Web from the core goals of Sirius Web.
These improvements are not complete and some of them will need to be improved down the road but the structure of the project is starting to be more visible.

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-007] Adopt stable identifiers for diagrams
- [ADR-008] Add support for incremental layout
- [ADR-009] Adopt a proper versioning strategy
- [ADR-010] Reduce the coupling of our collaborative support

=== Deprecation warning

- [core] The hook `useProject` will soon be removed. It's original goal was to provide the ability to subscribe to a project related subscription but this subscription has never really been used. It was way too much used to simply fetch a project while this could be done with way less dependencies
- [core] Any usage of `projectId` in the collaborative parts or in the representation related code will be removed in the upcoming months
- [core] All frontend code using our custom React widgets such as `Button`, `Text`, `Spacing`, `Checkbox` etc will be modified to use MaterialUI instead
- [core] All frontend code using custom made state machines instead of XState based ones will be migrated to XState

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Introduce the `sirius-web-core-api` project and move some core concepts from the services API into the new core API project such as `IEditingContext`, `IPayload` and `IInput`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Introduce the `sirius-web-services` project and move some business related concepts like `Document`, `Project` and `ProjectService` out of the collaborative projects
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the dependency to the persistence from the collaborative API
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the `Context` concept which was used to propagate the authenticated principal to the business code. It was given to more than 70 classes while used by only a couple of them. On top of that, Spring's `SecurityContextHolder` can perform the same job with a much lower coupling. This will help reduce the coupling between the collaborative parts and the services API
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the useless `IProjectInput` and replace its usage with `IInput`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove all dependencies to `sirius-web-services-api` from `sirius-web-collaborative-api`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the `ProjectRenamedEventPayload` to allow us to prepare the future deletion of the `useProject` hook and the complete removal of business concerns from the collaborative layer
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Rename the `ProjectEventProcessor` to `EditingContextEventProcessor`. This concept and its registry have been made independent of `Project`. Those concepts will stop relying on a `projectId` but an `editingContextId` instead even if in practice this variable will still contain the value of `projectId` for now.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the method `IEditingContext#getDomain`. This method will now only be available on the EMF specific version of the `IEditingContext`. This contraint was not useful for alternate implementations
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Move the `RenameRepresentationInput` to the `sirius-web-collaborative-api and `IObjectService` to the `sirius-web-core-api`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [explorer] Use `editingContextId` instead of `projectId` in the explorer
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [properties] Move properties related services to form related projects
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [diagram] Remove the dependency to `sirius-web-services-api` in `sirius-web-spring-collaborative-diagrams` thanks to the introduction of two new projects `sirius-web-diagrams-services-api` and `sirius-web-diagrams-services`. These two new projects are used to allow someone else to use a different persistence strategy for the diagrams. It will need to be refined but this solution allows us to isolate our dependency to the IRepresentationRepository
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/292[#292] [workbench] Restructure the components used by the workbench to make it reusable by consumers of Sirius Components. Components such as `DiagramWebSocketContainer` and `PropertiesWebSocketContainer` have thus been modified. In order to make it easier to reuse a Sirius Components workbench a component named `Workbench` has been created and new types such as `Selection`, `Representation` and `WorkbenchProps` have been introduced
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/303[#303] [business] Remove the link to modelers from the project context menu. Since we will not have time to fix the modelers before the release, we will not show this feature to end users and instead remove links to the modeler related pages

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/256[#256] [emf] Add support for composed images for `IObjectService#getImage`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/220[#220] [core] Add a basic support for the creation and edition of modelers
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/131[#131] [diagram] Add feedback to diagrams to indicate that tools cannot be applied
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/232[#232] [diagram] Add first support for incremental layout
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/153[#153] [workbench] Add the ability to close representations by adding a MaterialUI tabbar to display representations
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/293[#293] [workbench] Lower the coupling between the workbench and representations by introducing the `RepresentationContext` and the type `RepresentationComponentProps` for all representation components which replaces types such as `DiagramWebSocketContainerProps`. The `RepresentationContext` can be used to contribute additional representations to the Sirius Components workbench.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/296[#296] [core] Introduce the `ServerContext` in order to customize the URL of the server used by the frontend components. This will allow consumers of Sirius Components to specify a different `httpOrigin` to organize their frontend and backend in a very different manner

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/252[#252] [diagram] Improve the TypeScript typing of the `DiagramWebSocketContainer` with the introduction of `Selection` and a dedicated `DiagramWebSocketContainerProps`
- [releng] Trigger the build on any pull requests regardless of their origin
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/283[#283] [graphql] Add the `EditingContext` to the GraphQL API
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/261[#261] [emf] Improve the perform of the `DocumentService` by removing some useless loading and serializing steps of EMF resources
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/238[#238] [diagram] Migrate the `DiagramWebSocketContainer` to XState and MaterialUI

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/278[#278] [diagram] Ensure that we are always sending the latest diagram state and not the initial state when new users subscribe to an already opened diagram
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/295[#295] [diagram] Fix a bug which could lead to the creation of a diagram containing labels with the same identifier
