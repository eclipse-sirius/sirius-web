=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1374[#1374] [layout] The border node position is now updated when its parents bounds has changed (e.g. when a node increases its size because of a child creation).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1580[#1580] [diagram] Border nodes do not return to their previous position after they have been moved manually.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1522[#1522] [diagram] Rectangle nodes with a header can now be resized.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1720[#1720] [diagram] Fix the position where newly created views appear on a diagram after a drop


=== New Features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1567[#1567] [project] Add support for project templates.
Project templates are defined in the backend using the `IProjectTemplateProvider` (template metadata) and `IProjectTemplateInitializer` (project contents) interfaces.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1456[#1456] [diagram] Add the ability to filter the edge created using some graphical variables
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1456[#1456] [view] Add a precondition expression to the edge description
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1463[#1463] [diagram] Add support for the direct edit of the start and end labels of an edge. Two new tools can be defined on an edge in order to specify how the begin and end labels can be edited.
+
image:doc/images/View_edit_begin_and_end_labels.png[width=491,height=285]
+
For each of those tools, `Edit Begin Label` and `Edit End Label` in the previous screenshot, the specifier can also enter an `Initial Direct Edit Label Expression` which will be used to compute the initial value of the label when the edition will be triggered.
This is mostly used to support the edition of computed labels.
The variables `semanticEdgeSource` and `semanticEdgeTarget` are now available both in the `Initial Direct Edit Label Expression` and while evaluating the behavior of the tools themselves.
+
image:doc/images/View_edit_begin_label_initial_expression.png[width=522,height=224]
+
In order to edit a begin or end label of an edge, it is necessary to double click on said label.
Using `F2`` will trigger the edition of the center label of the edge.
+

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1496[#1496] [layout] Add the support for free form compartment.
+
image:doc/images/Free_form_layout_in_a_list_layout.png[A node with three free form compartment]

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1624[#1624] [diagram] Add support for expand/collapse of nodes.
A node can be collapsed or expanded if its view description is collapsible or if its sirius desktop description is a region (Horizontal or Vertical stack).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1624[#1624] [diagram] The `collapsingState` of a node is now available as a variable to compute its style.
As a result, it is possible to create a conditional style which will use the collapsing state quite easily.
Using the view DSL, one can use the expression `aql:collapsingState.toString() = 'COLLAPSED'` as a condition to create a style which will be used when the node is collapsed.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1584[#1584] [diagram] Studio makers can indicate whether or not a node type can be resized by the end-user or not.
Nodes which can not be resized (or have not been resized yet) haver their actual size computed from the NodeDescrition's sizeProvider in a uniform way for all node types.
Nodes which can and *have* been resized keep their user-chosen size across both incremental and full layout (as long as the requested size is compatible with other constraints).

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1583[#1583] [diagram] Add support for diagram nodes labels' auto-wrap
+
image:doc/images/Diagram_node_labels_auto_wrap.png[width=517,height=424]
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1588[#1588] [tree] Add support for enabling/disabling the synchronization between the explorer and the current selection.
When it is enabled, if the current selection is not visible in the explorer, it will be revealed by expanding the relevant tree items.
On the other hand, when it is disabled, the selection will be visible in the explorer but no tree items will be automatically expanded.


=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1559[#1559] [view] It is now possible to specify the (computed) width and height separately for a _Node Style_ (instead of a single size before, which always resulted in square shapes).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1560[#1560] Remove unused `EditingContextCompletionProposalsDataFetcher`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1426[#1426] [view] Add missing data type on initialDirectEditLabelExpression
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1456[#1456] [diagram] Add new methods to the diagram rendering cache to compute the parent, ancestors, children and descendants of a given node identifier
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1574[#1574] [diagram] Single click tools can now be executed on Edges in addition to Nodes
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1569[#1569] [view] Only delegate semantic deletion to the element's _Delete Tool_
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1562[#1562] [view] The default/canonical behaviors for diagram elements can now be invoked explicitly from AQL expressions. See `org.eclipse.sirius.components.view.emf.CanonicalServices`. This feature will be used only for internal for now. There will be breaking changes on this topic soon.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1596[#1596] [diagram] Sirius Web now includes two example parametric SVG images named "Package" and "Class".
They can be used as any custom image (e.g. in a View-based diagram), but their precise shape is partially computed on the backend, in this case to adjust the size of the label compartment to the actual label's width.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1563[#1563] [view] If a diagram description does not explicitly configure a delete/direct edit/element creation tool, the corresponding behavior is simply disabled.
By default, new nodes, edges and tools are explicitly configured to invoke the default canonical behavior; it is just made explicit in the model and can now serve as a based or removed to disable the behavior.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1558[#1558] [diagram] When a diagram is read-only, the following actions are now disabled: _Arrange All_, _Reveal hidden_ and _Reveal faded_ elements, and triggering direct edit or delete from the keyboard.

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1482[#1482] [core] Allow CustomImageLoader to get images from packaged projects. To import images from local files on startup, set `-Dorg.eclipse.sirius.web.customImages.pattern="file:///local/path/to/folder/with/files/**"`. To import images from a folder inside a packaged JAR, use `-Dorg.eclipse.sirius.web.customImages.pattern="classpath:path/in/jar/**"`. The syntax supports Ant-style path patterns.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1517[#1517] [core] Remove the error for strings which are not marked as non-externalized

=== New Features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1453[#1453] [diagram] Add new arrow styles Circle, FillCircle and CrossedCircle

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1386[#1386] [project] Users can now upload their own images from a project's new settings page (available in the project menu). These images can be displayed in forms using the new image widget, or in View-based diagrams using and ImageNodeStyleDescription and selecting the image in the list of available shapes.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1457[#1457] [diagram] Make possible to provide an expression on the label edit tool in View DSL to initialize the direct edit label text field. We kept the current behavior for the compatibility layer but, _in fine_ it will be possible to leverage the direct edit tool _Input Label Expression_ to initialize the direct edit label text field.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1346[#1346] [forms] Add support for a Rich Text edition widget. The widget behaves in a similar way to the existing Textfield and Textarea widgets, except that the text value should be valid Markdown, and can be edited in a WYSIWYG way by the end user.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1428[#1428] [layout] Add support for List layout compartment. We rely on the layout strategy engine handler switch and the layout engine handler switch to dispatch to the correct behavior depending on how children should be laid out and the type of the node. This kind of architecture has already been implemented for model operation for the View DSL. Nothing has changed if nodes have to be laid out freely.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1439[#1439] [form] Add support for toolbar actions in Form/FormDescriptionEditor
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1437[#1437] [form] Add support for styles preview in FormDescriptionEditor

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1507[#1507] [diagram] Missing variables during execution of a source reconnection tool from the View description (otherEnd,semanticOtherEnd,edgeView and editingContext)
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1521[#1521] [view] Canonical creation tools from contextual toolbar have no icons
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1467[#1467] [layout] Elk is now able to compute a list layout. It is an internal change, and thus, nothing should change for the end user

== v2022.11.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-069] Add support for children layout strategy
- [ADR-070] How to contribute a new diagram node style
- [ADR-071] Add parametric SVG node style
- [ADR-072] Add support for the edition of routing points
- [ADR-073] Add support for intermodel references (inside the same project)
- [ADR-074] Add support for edge reconnection

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1300[#1300] [core] Rename SiriusWebJSONResourceFactoryImpl to JSONResourceFactoryImpl
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1301[#1301] [core] Add support for having intermodel references. Now, the URI of resources added in a ResourceSet must have a `scheme`. Otherwise, you will  encounter exceptions.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1064[#1064] [core] Remove the URL utility file and ask for the `httpOrigin` instead. Consumers of Sirius Components which rely on the behavior of the URL utility file should instead maintain their own utility file since it is dependent on our build technology and development process.

=== Dependency update

- [backend] Switch to EMFJson 2.3.2-SNAPSHOT. It contains better management of proxy resolution in case of intermodel references

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1368[#1368] [diagram] Do not render rectangle view children twice
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/931[#931] [layout] When the delete tool of an edge is used, the position of other edges are not affected.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1392[#1392] [core] Fix EditingContextCrossReferenceAdapter for derived references
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1411[#1411] [vscode-extension] Fix a 404 error on the VSCode extension page when loading the image
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1454[#1454] [vscode-extension] Fix a misprint in VSCode Extension README

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1339[#1339] [layout] Add concept of layout strategy. The purpose of layout strategy is to split the style of a node from the way a node lays out its children.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1385[#1385] [releng] Migrate the backend and frontend code of Sirius Web to Sirius Component. The purpose of this migration is to facilitate the maintenance of these two projects (one pull request instead of two different).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/997[#997] [diagram] Edge routing points are not reset when one of the edge end is moving
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1387[#1387] [releng] Migrate VSCode Extension to Sirius Components.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1423[#1423] [forms] In-browser spell-checking is now disabled on textfields.

=== New Features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1316[#1316] [diagram] Support parametric svg node style
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/997[#997] [diagram] Add support for edition of routing points in diagrams

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/780[#780] [diagram] Add support for edge reconnection. Edge reconnection descriptions can be defined either inside a classical Sirius desktop VSM or, using the View DSL. While using the Sirius desktop VSM you can define a tool to do both target and source reconnection, you will need to define a tool to reconnect the source and another one to reconnect the target using the View DSL

== v2022.9.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-067] Add support for injecting platform services/beans into Java service classes used by studios
- [ADR-068] Improve support for precondition expression from representation description

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1311[#1311] [releng] Allow reusing `sirius-components-emf` without dependencies to the domain or view DSL. As a result, two new projects `sirius-components-domain-emf` and `sirius-components-view-emf` have been introduced in order to connect the EMF compatibility layer with the domain and view DSL. Consumers of `sirius-components-emf` may have to update their import. The behavior of the code has not been modified
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1311[#1311] [releng] Allow reusing `sirius-component-emf` without dependencies to Sirius Desktop. As a result, a new project `sirius-components-compatibility-emf` has been added in order to provide EMF support for the Sirius desktop compatibility layer. Consumers of `sirius-components-emf` may have to update their import. The behavior of the code has not been modified
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1237[#1237] [releng] Remove the two hardcoded dependencies to Spring MVC from Sirius Components. As such, reusing most components from Sirius Components without Spring MVC will be easier. The only projects with a dependency to Spring MVC are located in the `web` package
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1312[#1312] [graphql] Provide the datafetchers used by the representations. Starting with the validation representation, we will provide datafetchers directly in Sirius Components to simplify the integration of Sirius Components in various applications. The project `sirius-components-graphql-utils` has been merged into `sirius-components-graphql-api` since they had similar dependencies.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [charts] The components related to charts have been extracted to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-charts`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [forms] The components related to forms have been extracted to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-forms`. The views and representations have adopted the suffix `View` and `Representation` respectively. As an example, the component `FormWebSocketContainer` is now named `FormRepresentation`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [formdescriptioneditors] The components related to formdescriptioneditors have been extracted to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-formdescriptioneditors`. The representation has been renamed `FormDescriptionEditorRepresentation`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [core] Since the core parts of Sirius Components cannot possibily known the components of the representations installed in a project, the context `RepresentationContext` will not provide a default value anymore. In a similar fashion, the `ServerContext` from `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-core` will now be required in order to let Sirius Components retrieve the URL of the backend.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [trees] The trees related components and the explorer have been extracted to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-trees`. The `ExplorerWebSocketContainer` has also been renamed `ExplorerView` to match the naming convention of the other views. The components migrated have also been fully converted to XState and MaterialUI
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [workbench] The workbench was depending on some tree components in order to compute the list of `TreeItemContextMenuContribution` to use in the explorer. This dependency has been removed and as a result, users of the workbench component will have to rely on the `TreeItemContextMenuContext` to provide the contributions
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [workbench] Move the workbench related code to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-core`. This move includes components such as `Workbench`, `RepresentationContext`, `WorkbenchViewContribution` for example
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [diagram] Move the code of the diagram and the selection wizard in the packages `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-diagrams` and `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-selection`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [core] Some code remain in the soon to be deprecated Sirius Component package `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components`. Most of this code will either be moved to Sirius Web or be removed entirely (such as the old non MaterialUI widgets)
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1288[#1288] [core] The `EditingContext#representationDescriptions` field now takes an `objectId: ID` as argument instead of just the object's `kind: ID`.
This allows representation precondition expressions to be more precise as they know the actual candidate instance, not just its type.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1281[#1281] [form] The `LinkDescription` now requires a `displayProvider` and a `styleProvider`. The `displayProvider` is used to display the text of the hyperLink.
The GraphQL API has also been changed with two additional fields on the type `Link`: `display` and `style` (optional). The front-end use the `display` value instead of the `label` value to display the hyperlink text.
The `label` value is displayed before the widget to be consistent with other properties sections.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1320[#1320] [diagram] The `selectedNode` variable is now always _defined_ in the context of drop hanlders and single-click tools. Previously, if the target of the drop or single-click tool was the diagram itself (instead of a node), the variable was not defined at all. Now it is defined but `null` in these cases.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1289[#1289] [core] The `representationDescriptions` GraphQL query now returns a new attribute named `defaultName` in addition to the `label` and `id`. For view-based representations and , the `defaultName` is computed from the `RepresentationDescription`'s `titleExpression`.

=== Dependency update

- [frontend] Update the format of the `package-lock.json` by moving to node 18.7.0 and npm 8.15.0. This will allow us to use the latest version of npm which comes with improvements for its workspace support. This will also help us move beyond the change in behavior of https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4998[node 16.15.1 and npm 8.6]
- [frontend] Update the version of `jest-transform-css` used in order to fix the long standing issues of its incompatibility with the version of `postcss`` that we use. We will thus use `postcss 8.4.14` and `jest-transform-css 4.0.1` now
- [frontend] Remove our dependency to `ts-transform-graphql-tag` since it is not maintained and its dependencies are outdated and since it is used to lower the dependency with `graphql-tag` which we will stop using soon
- [frontend] Remove the peer dependency to `graphql-tag`. It will not be required for projects consuming Sirius Components now
- [frontend] Remove the peer dependency to `subscriptions-transport-ws`. It is not required by Sirius Components and consumers of Sirius Components will be free to switch to `graphql-ws` instead of even to not rely on web socket at all to communicate with the backend. Sirius Components itself does not need to specify how the communication with the backend will be done
- [frontend] Switch to `@apollo/client 3.6.9`, `@material-ui/core 4.12.4`, `@material-ui/icons 4.11.3`, `graphql 16.5.0`, `prop-types 15.8.1`, `sprotty 0.12.2` and `xstate 4.32.1`. Various development dependencies have also been updated such as typescript, rollup, prettier etc
- [backend] Switch to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.7.2[Spring Boot 2.7.2]
- [backend] Switch to the managed version of GraphQL Java, as of Spring Boot 2.7.2, we will thus use GraphQL Java 18.2

== v2022.7.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-60] Add support for d3 bars data-structure and bar-chart representation
- [ADR-61] Add support for flexbox containers on form description

- [ADR-63] Simplify the Sprotty integration
- [ADR-64] Add support for a ToggableAreaContainer in forms
- [ADR-65] Add support for a tree widget in forms
- [ADR-66] Add a new "Related Elements" view

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1141[#1141] [frontend] The `PropertiesWebSocketContainer` which was hard-coded to display the `propertiesEvent` subscription has been made more generic and renamed `FormBasedView`.
It now takes an additional prop named `subscriptionName` so that it can be bound to other subscriptions (which must follow the same API/protocol and send Form payloads).
To integrate the "Details" view inside a workbench, one must now use the new `DetailsView` component (which simply configures `FormBasedView` to listen to `propertiesEvent` as before).

=== Dependency update

- The frontend now depends on `@material-ui/lab` to support the new https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1139[tree widget] (see ADR-065).

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1214[#1214] [forms] The mandatory label attribute which was available in all concrete widget types is now explicitly part of the common supertype.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1215[#1215] [forms] Widgets can now optionally specify an `iconURL`. It is not used in the default UI for the details view or forms representations for now, but icons (if present) are visible in the toggle buttons bar for groups using the new `displayMode = TOGGLEABLE_AREAS`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1141[#1141] [workbench] It is now possible to add a "Related View" contribution to the workbench.
It behaves like the "Details" view in that it reacts to the selection by displaying a Form, but is designed to display contextual information about the selected element (i.e. which elements it points to and which elements point to it for example).
The actual definition of the application (e.g. Sirius Web), which must provide a single bean implementing the new `IRelatedElementsDescriptionProvider` interface.

=== Deprecation warning

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1088[#1088] [core] Change the type of `IRepresentationDescription#id` from UUID to String.
This will allow us, when we will receive an operation to perform with a given representation description identifier, to determine if this operation should be handled by the Sirius Desktop compatibility layer, the View support or by a programmatic API
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1138[#1138] [workbench] The APIs for the `Panels` and `Site` components have been modified to support closing/opening the panels.
In particular, `Panels` now handles all three parts of the layout (the left and right sites and the main area) directly instead of using recursive two-sided panels.
See ADR-54 for the details.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1155[#1155] [workbench] `WorkbenchViewContribution` now require an `icon` prop
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1155[#1155] [core] The palette used by Sirius Components now require two additional colors for the navigation area. The type of the new palette is described in `frontend/src/materialui.ts`. Users of the fallback theme can upgrade without having to add those new colors since they are provided by default.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/966[#966] [core] The source and target edge anchor are not considered as routing points anymore. Edges of old diagrams may have unexpected behavior since new edges will have two less routing points than existing edges in old diagrams. For further explanation see ADR-054.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1180[#1180] [diagram] An implementation of `IConnectorToolsProvider` has to be made for the connector tool to work.

=== Dependency update

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1118[#1118] [core] Switch to Spring Boot 2.6.6
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1118[#1118] [core] Switch to GraphQL Java 18.0

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1140[#1140] [forms] The frontend now depends on `@material-ui/lab` version 4.0.0-alpha.61

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1154[#1154] [diagram] Display the palette where the click has been made, not where the cursor is. With the edge animation it was possible for the palette to be displayed at a wrong position which was making possible to create a floating edge.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1148[#1148] [diagram] Fix a lot of cases where removing an edge will change the layout of some other edges. This behavior will still happen when it will exist two edges between the two same elements and one of the edge is removed, the other edge will probably take the layout of the removed edge.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1176[#1176] [diagram] Fix potential ConcurrentModificationException in ViewDiagramDescriptionConverter when manipulating diagrams. This bug was introduced by the https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1152[#1152].

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1155[#1155] [workbench] The left and right panels now use a vertical bar of icons (instead of accordions) to select which view to display
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/966[#966] [diagram] Add the support source and target edge position ratio on the frontend side. For further explanation see ADR-055.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1179[#1179] [core] Move `WorkbenchSelection` and `WorkbenchSelectionEntry` to `sirius-components-representations` in order to let any representation use those classes. We may rename the `Selection` representation in the future in order to rename them to `Selection` and `SelectionEntry` to align the frontend and backend API
- [releng] Detect the presence of classes without a public visibility or with a package or protected constructor in order to speed up the code reviews.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1138[#1138] [workbench] The left and right panels can be closed by clicking on the current view's icon or by resizing them to the minimum widht (showing only the icons).
When closed, clicking on any of the views' icon will re-open the panel to make the selected view visible.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/689[#689] [diagram] Add a variable containing objects ids to render for unsynchronized nodes rendering

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1149[#1149] [form] Add support for form descriptions in the View DSL

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1117[#1117] [diagram] Add support for multiple selections in a diagram. This work only display the various selection entries in the diagram. It does not support Ctrl+click or ⌘+click in a diagram. Support for this feature would require additional work with major improvements in the lifecycle of the `DiagramServer``
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1146[#1146] [core] Add support for EditingContext actions
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1152[#1152] [form] Add support for form descriptions in the view converter

== v2022.3.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-039] Provide a variable to detect the environment
- [ADR-040] Add support for a post selection
- [ADR-041] Add the ability to contribute additional services to the EMFQueryService
- [ADR-042] Use wildcard collections instead of List<Object> in Providers
- [ADR-043] Consider multiple objects as the input of a form
- [ADR-044] Use border node "snap to parent container" algorithm

- [ADR-046] Make the workbench panels' content configurable
- [ADR-047] Add support for tools preconditions
- [ADR-048] Rename concepts related to tools
- [ADR-049] Improve the incremental layout for dropper elements

=== Deprecation warning
- [core] The various DTOs related to the creation and renaming of both documents and representations will be removed from the project at some point. The only reason why we will keep them for the moment is that some of them are used to trigger some specific behavior in the `EditingContextEventProcessor`. The split of the representation metadata should help us remove those special use cases
- [core] The method `IRepresentationMetadataSearchService#findByRepresentation` will be deleted in the future, it only exists as a transition from requesting the whole content of a representation everytime to requesting only its metadata when it's necessary
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/779[#779] [diagram] The properties `DiagramDescription#toolSections` should be removed in the near future since it has no real reason to exist now that the tools are computed on the fly. On top of that, `ITool.handler` will also be deleted at the same time since we no longer need to create the handlers of all the tools while the server is starting
- [diagram] The GraphQL mutations `deleteFromDiagram` will stop being used soon by the delete from model and delete from diagram tools. They will instead be considered as regular tools and thus leverage the "invoke tool" GraphQL API

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/808[#808] [core] Update the namespace of the projects from `sirius-web-xxx` to `sirius-components-xxx`. The projects `sirius-web-api` and `sirius-web-core-api` have been merged into `sirius-components-core` since there was no difference in scope between both projects and neither of them was strictly limited to an api. Since we have validated that most of our projects can be reused outside of a Spring environment (i.e. an environment where Spring Frameworks is in charge of the ApplicationContext), we have also removed the `-spring-` from most of our project names. We already had Spring dependencies outside of those `-spring-` projects anyway.
- [core] Switch to the `org.eclipse.sirius` groupId in order to prepare for a future publication of our backend on maven central
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/808[#808] [core] Update the namespace of the packages from `org.eclipse.sirius.web.xxx` to `org.eclipse.sirius.components.xxx`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/998[#998] [core] Remove the various annotations used to support a code-first approach to build the GraphQL schema
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/975[#975] [core] Remove useless parts of the GraphQL API which were both unused by the Sirius Components frontend and not handled by the Sirius Components backend
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/959[#959] [diagram] Remove the concept of `DeleteTool`. This concept was not useful since any tool can perform a deletion
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1018[#1018] [core] Remove the default implementation of `IRepresentationMetadataSearchService` since products integrating Sirius Components needs the ability to customize its behavior
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1019[#1019] [core] Services now have access to the context of the request triggering their execution. Consumer of Sirius Components will have to provide the `RequestAttributes`` in the `RequestContextHolder`` to make the `EditingContextEventProcessor`` work. It should be very easy for those in a Spring environment, but it is not automatic for those outside of a Spring environment
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/699[#699] [core] The `IRepresentationImageProvider` will now use the `kind` of the representation instead of the instance to compute the image. It will allow users to ask for the image of a representation with either its instance or its metadata
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/699[#699] [core] Add the `targetObjectId` to the `RepresentationMetadata`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1045[#1045] [core] Providers will now return List<?> instead of List<Object>. This makes it possible for applications to reuse existing services to implement providers without making useless copies of lists
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1068[#1068] [form] The form representation is now supporting multiple elements as an input
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1068[#1068] [workbench] The integration of the details view in the workbench is not limited to semantic objects with a kind starting with `siriusComponents://semantic`. Any object can be used as the input of the details view and we will now provide the identifier of all the objects in the selection. This may include graphical elements such as nodes, edges, representations or anything selected in the explorer for example
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/693[#693] [workbench] The workbench non longer hard-codes the views which are visible in the left and right side-panels. Instead, each application must explicitly configure its workbench using the new `WorkbenchViewContribution` element. See ADR-046 for more details. As part of this change, the `ExplorerWebSocketContainerProps`, `PropertiesWebSocketContainerProps`, `RepresentationsWebSocketContainerProps` and `ValidationWebSocketContainer` types have been removed and replaced with the single `WorkbenchViewComponentProps` type which is structurally equivalent.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/779[#779] [diagram] Change the signature of the GraphQL API used to retrieve the tools of the diagram's contextual palette in order to include the identifier of the diagram element
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1022[#1022] [diagram] The `NodeCreationEvent` and the `EdgeCreationEvent` have been renamed to `SinglePositionEvent` and `DoublePositionEvent` to distinguish from from any imagined behavior. Additional tests of the incremental layout should be added in the future to test its behavior in use cases that we did not consider in the past. The `CreateNodeTool` and `CreateEdgeTool` have also been renamed in order to describe how the user interact with them instead of the behavior that we imagine they have. Their associated mutations have also been renamed. See the ADR for additional details

=== Dependency update

- [core] Switch to Spring Boot 2.6.4

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/985[#985] [core] Provide a variable to detect which environment is used. The value of the variable will change to something specific for the integrating application (for example siriusWeb). This is only available for the diagram for now

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/956[#956] [diagram] Add the border node concept on front-end and implement the border node snap. The user can move the border node only on the side of its parent node. The border node enters its parent node with 8px. The ELK automatic layout is adapated to have the same behavior.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1081[#1081] [workbench] It is now possible to specify the component to display in the main area when no representation is open instead of the `OnboardArea` (which is still the default when there is no override)
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1070[#1070] [explorer] When selecting an element or opening a representation (for example from its URL or from the onboard area), it is automatically made visible and selected in the explorer.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1071[#1071] [diagram] Add a label for the border nodes
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1071[#1071] [diagram] Improve the resizing of the border nodes
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/783[#783] [diagram] Nodes which use images can now also have a border with all the relevant properties: color, size, radius, and line style. This applies to modelers using the compatibility layer and the web-based diagram definitions
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1033[#1033] [view] It is now possible to configure all properties of node's border in web-based diagrams, including the border line style

- [ADR-38] Improve the layout of multiple edges between the same nodes

=== Deprecation warning
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/858[#858] [core] Our dependency to Spring Security will be reduced or eliminated soon. Sirius Components will now longer have any opinion on matters of authentication, authorization, principal management, etc. All those concerns will be out of the scope of the project. It will also be way easier to integrate Sirius Components in a Spring based application since it won't come with this additional requirement

=== Breaking changes
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/858[#858] [core] Remove most of the methods of `ISubscriptionManager` since they were not really useful
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/871[#871] [core] Change the constructor of the `EditingContextEventProcessor` in order to let consumers provide an `IEditingContextEventProcessorExecutorServiceProvider`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/134[#134] [workbench] Switch from a single-selection API to a multi-selection API with some changes to the `Selection` object of the workbench
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/878[#878] [core] As specified in the ADR-36, the kind of an object (representation, semantic elements, selection entry of the workbench) is now an URI. All previous kind values have been modified
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/878[#878] [graphql] The GraphQL argument `classId` which appeared on some fields has been replaced by `kind` since it was always the `kind` of an object. Technically, it is always the kind of a semantic element but that may not be the case forever
- [core] `IEditService.findClass()` has been removed
- [core] `IRepresentationDescriptionSearchService` has a new `findAll` method to return all the representation descriptions available in a given editing context
- [core] The package containing the concepts related to the editing context has been renamed to remove references to the project
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/932[#932] [graphql] Introduce the RepresentationMetadata concept in order to prepare the separation of the metadata from the representation

- [frontend] Switch to @typescript-eslint/parser 5.7.0
- [frontend] Switch to xstate 4.26.1
- [frontend] Update various development dependencies such as Rollup, ESLint, Pretier and Jest

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/726[#726] [view] Nodes can now have a dynamically computed size (using `sizeComputationExpression`) which depends on the current state of the semantic model.
If the expression is present and produces a positive integer, it will be used as both the width and height of the node, in pixels.
Currently it is not possible to compute different values for width and height.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/133[#133] [diagram] Add a connector tool to help create edges in diagrams
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/596[#596] [view] It is now possible to define border nodes in dynamic diagram definitions

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/822[#822] [view] Handle 'Delete from Diagram' in view-based diagrams

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/871[#871] [core] An `IEditingContextEventProcessorExecutorServiceProvider` can be given to the `EditingContextEventProcessor` in order to customize the `ExecutorService` which will be used to handle the processing of the `IInput` received. This will allow consumers to change the thread management policy of Sirius Components
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/134[#134] [workbench] The internal API of the workbench is now ready to accept features leveraging a multi-selection
- [form] Add a tooltip to always make the full label available

== v2021.12.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-032] Relax our ID policy for editing context and representation (update)
- [ADR-034] Switch from semver to calver
- [ADR-035] Use a common pattern for configuration properties
- [ADR-036] Adopt a more structured selection

=== Deprecation warning

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/818[#818] [workbench] The concept of `Selection` will be restructured, as described in the ADR-036. Every part of the code involved in the manipulation of the selection of the workbench will be impacted. This includes concepts as remote as the representation descriptions which are used to computed fields like `kind`. For example, the behavior of the `TreeDescription#getKindProvider` and `NodeDescription#getTargetObjectKindProvider` will have to be updated for all the providers. Failure to update to the new behavior will make the selection fail in the workbench
- [core] The Success parameterless contructor will be removed soon.

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/804[#804] [core] Update the name of our configuration properties. The configuration property `sirius.web.graphql.websocket.allowed.origins` will now be `sirius.components.cors.allowedOriginPatterns` and it will support complex patterns on top of regular origins. The default value will be restored to nothing since it has temporarily been set to `*`. In a development environment, the recommended value would be both patterns `https://localhost:[*]` and `http://localhost:[*]` in order to accept requests from any application hosted on the same machine. The configuration property `org.eclipse.sirius.web.editingContextEventProcessorRegistry.disposeDelay` will now be `sirius.components.editingContext.disposeDelay`. Its default value will be 1s since it is the only realistic option with domain and view support.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/692[#692] [explorer] The explorer view is now more generic and extensible. It can represent arbitrary kinds of tree items, but the tree items supported must be configured for each application.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/700[#700] [core] editingContextId and representationId are no longer UUID but String. Products that rely on sirius-components will be able to have their own ID policy for the editingContextId and representationId.

=== Dependency update

- [core] Switch to Spring Boot 2.5.6

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/773[#773] [compatibility] Add support for both `createView` and `deleteView` model operations which can be used to support unsynchronized diagrams from Sirius Desktop.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/694[#694] [core] Add `IRepresentationRefreshPolicyRegistry` to contribute `IRepresentationRefreshPolicyProvider`s in order to customize on which kind of change description, representations will be refreshed.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/613[#613] [compatibility] Add support for external java action with the new API `IExternalJavaActionProvider` which allows others to provide instances of `IExternalJavaAction` in order to perform some custom behavior during the execution of a tool for example.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/154[#154] [diagram] Add support for the edition of the label of an edge

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/799[#799] [diagram] The buttons in the diagram's toolbar now have proper tooltips
- [core] Add a task to display TypeScript errors in the VS Code problems view
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/773[#773] [compatibility] The synchronization policy of the node descriptions is now properly computed from the `AbstractNodeMapping`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/694[#694] [core] Data can be provided to Success in order to notify changment made by operation made on the editing context.
- [explorer] The context menus on explorer items has been migrated to Material UI
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/692[#692] [tree] The tree representation will now act as a proper representation. Its event handlers will now be implementations of  `ITreeEventHandler` and its input will be implementations of `ITreeInput`
- [diagram] The variable `selectedNode` is now available even if there are no `selectedObject` from a selection representation
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/817[#817] [core] Improve the TypeScript typing of the frontend
- [form] Add support for property groups defined in a different category

=== Bug fixes

- [diagram] The variable `selectedNode` was only available in the variable manager used when executing node tools if a selection dialog was also available. Now the `selectedNode` variable will always be available unless the tool has been invoked on the background of the diagram

== v0.5.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-024] Add support for view deletion requests
- [ADR-025] Switch to a schema first approach for our GraphQL schema
- [ADR-026] Improve the performance of unsynchronized nodes
- [ADR-027] Make the explorer independent from modeling concepts
- [ADR-028] Move representations out of the explorer
- [ADR-029] Introduce some object services
- [ADR-030] Add a link representation
- [ADR-031] Separate metadata representations
- [ADR-032] Relax our constraints on some of our identifiers
- [ADR-033] Add support for unsynchronized tools

=== Deprecation warning

- [core] The field `ChangeKind#NOTHING` will be removed soon since we have the option to just not send anything at all
- [explorer] Representations will be removed from the explorer soon
- [core] The metadata of the representations will be removed from the content of the representation soon. As a result, fields like `IRepresentation#id`, `IRepresentation#descriptionId` or event `IRepresentation#label` will be removed. It will allow us to massively improve the performance of some use cases and simplify the manipulation of the representations in other use cases
- [workbench] The workbench will become independent of internal concepts from Sirius Components. As a result, the explorer will not have any hardcoded actions such as "create a new document" or "create a new representation". The concept of document will be removed from the frontend entirely
- [graphql] The interface `ITypeProvider` will soon be removed
- [graphql] All the GraphQL annotations used to build the schema programatically will be removed soon such as `@GraphQLObjectType`, `@GraphQLField`, `@GraphQLNonNull`, `@GraphQLID`. Annotations used to execute GraphQL queries like `@QueryDataFetcher` or `@MutationDataFetcher` will still be supported

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/673[#673] [graphql] Rename namespace to domain in the GraphQL API
- [core] Remove the need to give a looger to the `BaseRender`
- [properties] Remove useless fields from the properties payloads
- [graphql] Use pagination for the fields used by the onboarding such as `EditingContext#stereotypeDescriptions` or `EditingContext#representations`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/563[#563] [core] Update the support for custom images by referencing images by their identifiers instead of their file name
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/683[#683] [core] Move projects such as `sirius-web-services-api`, `sirius-web-services`, `sirius-web-graphql-schema` and `sirius-web-graphql` out of Sirius Components
- [core] Remove all the `sirius-web-collaborative-XXX-api` projects. Those projects became a random collection of all the interfaces (external APIs and internal ones) used by the collaborative projects. Those interfaces now exist within the various collaborative projects
- [graphql] Remove the field `ErrorPayload#additionalMessages` since it was useless
- [graphql] Remove the principal from the GraphQL `Context` since Spring Security allows us to access it much more easily
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/744[#744] [core] Use Reactor to communicate event handler results. As a result of this change, the concept of `EventHandlerResponse` has been removed and replaced with two different sinks. The `payloadSink` should be used to communicate a response to the process which has sent the input to handler. The `changeDescriptionSink` can be used in order to indicate to the other event processors a change that has occur. Such change may trigger a refresh or other behavior in the other event processors
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/727[#727] [core] Make `IRepresentationDescriptionSearchService` editing context aware
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/750[#750] [core] Add the ability to provide a status error message. The enumeration `Status` has been replaced by an interface named `IStatus` with two classes implementing it, `Failure` and `Success`. Thanks to `Failure`, it is now possible to provide a custom error message for an event handler but as of today this error message is not used in the `ErrorPayload` created from the `Failure`. This will change in the future
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/740[#740] [domain] Remove the explicit `nsURI` from domain definitions. Now only a name will be required and other properties will be computed from said name (`nsURI` and `nsPrefix`).

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/190[#190] [emf] Add support for inverse references navigation thanks to an `ECrossReferenceAdapter` installed directly on the `EditingContext`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/588[#588] [domain] Add support for multiple inheritance
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/598[#598] [view] Add support for node border size, edge width, label font format and node label color in the view language
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/514[#514] [diagram] Disable move, resize and arrange all on auto-layout diagram
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/688[#688] [core] Add support for cross site request forgery token while uploading files. Projects integrating Sirius Components will have to decide whether or not they want to add such support and if they want to activate it. It will not be supported for now in Sirius Web
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/671[#671] [graphql] Add the GraphQL schemas of Sirius Components. Starting with this commit, projects integrating Sirius Components will be able to easily embrace a schema first approach to build their GraphQL schema. It will also be way easier to track changes to our GraphQL schema over time
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/697[#697] [graphql] Add the ability to perform AQL based queries on the content of an editing context using the `queryBasedXxx` fields
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/672[#672] [diagram] Add support for the `ViewDeletionRequest` in a similar fashion as the previously added `ViewCreationRequest` in order to support unsynchronized diagram description created programmatically

=== Improvements

- [domain] Add multiple validation rules to help create proper domains
- [view] Add validation rules to help create proper views
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/646[#646] [view] Improve the default color used for new edges in the view language
- [core] Replace most `NoOpXxx` classes by internal `NoOp` classes on each interface
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/674[#674] [core] Use the Spring Security executor service to propagate the current principal in the thread of the `EditingContextEventProcessor` instead of relying on our custom solution
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/680[#680] [validation] Ensure that the validation view is open by default
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/690[#690] [diagram] Add the `selectedNode` variable to the delete from diagram and invoke node tool handlers
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/638[#638] [diagram] Leverage the automatic layout configuration while computing the incremental layout in order to fix differences in behavior between the incremental layout and the automatic layout
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/719[#719] [compatibility] Add support for the `container` and `element` variables for the node/container creation tools
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/729[#729] [emf] Make sure that the resource set of our `EditingContext` is an `IEditingDomainProvider`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/731[#731] [view] Allow an `EdgeDescription` to have multiple sources and targets

- [workbench] Improve the overflow management of the onboarding area
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/795[#795] [domain] Custom-defined domains now appear first in the new root object modal

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/654[#654] [domain] Set `Feature#optional` default value to `true` since `false` created serialization issues. We cannot provide `false` as a default value since EMF cannot handle such use case
- [diagram] Make the `DiagramRenderingCache` maps predictable in order to improve performances
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/735[#735] [view] Ensure that the generic edge tool is not used when a custom one is provided
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/747[#747] [diagram] Fix bounding box computation for images with wide labels
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/738[#738] [view] Fix the validation rules of the views when using qualified domain type names
- [view] Consider conditional styles when computing a node type. This bug could lead to the creation of diagrams where node declared a specific type that did not match the type of their style. As a result, we could create diagrams that we could not deserialize with our Jackson parser
- [core] Add a fallback strategy to the payload sink. With the use of reactor to the event handler, it has become possible to handle an input without ever providing a payload as a response. Now after 5s without a response, an `ErrorPayload` will be send back. This will not stop the current processing of the input nor will it rollback any change made, it will only send a response to ensure that the frontend is not waiting forever for an answer
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/776[#776] [view] Avoid id collision between diagram descriptions with the same name by leveraging the URI of the diagram description to create a more unique identifier


== v0.4.0 (2021-07-30)

This new release improves support for meta modeling.
It also prepares the removal of a lot of code from this repository.
Sirius Components will soon be independent from any persistence layer, from the GraphQL layer and even from a specific business layer.

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-020] Add support for validation in the workbench
- [ADR-021] Add validation support to forms
- [ADR-022] Add support for selection dialog
- [ADR-023] Move business code from Sirius Components to Sirius Web

=== Deprecation warning

- [core] All the GraphQL and business related projects will be move to the Sirius Web project. As a result, projects such as `sirius-web-services-api`, `sirius-web-services`, `sirius-web-graphql-schema` and `sirius-web-graphql` will no longer exist in this repository

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/569[#569] [emf] Move document-related code out of `sirius-web-emf`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/569[#569] [core] Remove the last dependency to `sirius-web-services` from `sirius-web-emf`. As a result, the `ObjectService` does not need to know about representations anymore
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/562[#562] [graphql] Remove references to `projectId` from the subscriptions and use `editingContextId` instead
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/562[#562] [graphql] Move the `representation` and `representations` fields from `Project` to `EditingContext`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/562[#562] [core] Remove multiple references to `projectId` from the collaborative parts. This will impact various concepts such as the input used to edit forms
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/584[#584] [graphql] Remove all the GraphQL projects from `sirius-web-spring-starter`. As such, projects consumming Sirius Components will now have to explicitely depend to those projects. They will soon be removed entirely from Sirius Components to go Sirius Web
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/584[#584] [core] Remove the need to perform some access control and remove the `IDataFetcherEnvironmentService` in favor of `ObjectMapper`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/589[#589] [core] Remove `sirius-web-services` from `sirius-web-spring-starter`. Our business layer will soon be moved out of Sirius Components to Sirius Web
- [core] Remove the unused `ProjectCreatedEvent`
- [core] Remove the support for modelers since it has never been used
- [core] Refactor the collaborative layer in order to make it easier to reuse in other applications. This change includes a large set of small API breaks to concepts such as `IRepresentationService` or `IRepresentationSearchService`
- [core] Provide the editing context while searching and saving representations instead of its identifier. As a result, interfaces such as `IRepresentationPersistenceService` and `IRepresentationSearchService` have been modified

== v0.3.0 (2021-05-18)

In this third major release, we have introduced support for the meta modeling in the web browser with the new domain and view languages.

In order to make Sirius Components even more reusable, we have removed all of the views of the frontend.
Sirius Components will no longer have an opinion on the architecture of the whole frontend application which will include the workbench.
It will only provide as frontend components, representations, the workbench and some utility components but not the core structure of a full web application.

On the backend side, things are moving in the same direction with some massive refactoring for the future removal of the persistence layer and the business layer from Sirius Components.
All the related projects will soon move to Sirius Web in order to integrate more easily Sirius Components in applications which do not share the same architectural constraints as Sirius Web.

Some improvements have also been made to the incremental layout in order to support a basic workflow.


=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-011] Decouple the event handlers from the refresh
- [ADR-012] Incremental layout: Make it possible to move or create a diagram element at a specific position
- [ADR-013] Refactor incremental layout
- [ADR-014] Add a correlation identifier to inputs and payloads
- [ADR-015] Add support for resizing diagram elements
- [ADR-016] Remove SubscriptionDescription
- [ADR-017] Improve the source and target edge anchors
- [ADR-018] Adopt a subset of Ecore to define data schemas for modelers
- [ADR-019] Support Simple Diagram Definitions by Reusing Sirius Desktop VSMs

=== Deprecation warning

- [core] All the business code will be removed from Sirius Components in the months to come (project, document, persistence-related code, etc). This will include projects such as `sirius-web-persistence`, `sirius-web-services-api` and more
- [core] The support for custom images has been integrated as a prototype. Massive changes to its API will occur in the future in order to cleanup its lifecycle
- [core] The concept `IDataFetchingEnvironmentService` which can be used to setup an access control policy will soon be removed since it will be up to each application to define its own policy

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/152[#152] [releng] Remove usage of `airbnb-props-types` and `universal-cookies` since we don't need them
- [core] Make views handle the lifecycle of their navbar instead of relying on a common navbar design and lifecycle. This will lower the complexity of the lifecycle of the views and give way more flexibility to the views
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/342[#342] [core] Introduce the `ChangeKind` concept to decouple event handlers from representation. Prior to this change, an event handler had to know the behavior of all the representations in order to find out which representations were impacted by its change. Now, it can describe the change made and each representation can find out if this change is relevant to them or not
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/348[#348] [core] Add a correlation identifier on `IInput` and `IPayload`. From now on all payloads created must have, as an identifier, the identifier of the input which has trigger their creation. This will give us the ability to provide advanced features in the future and improve our debugging capabilities now
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/351[#351] [core] Transform `ChangeKind` into `ChangeDescription` in order to encapsulate the source of the change too. This will allow a representation to distinguish between a `SEMANTIC_CHANGE` coming from another representation and one coming from itself
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/347[#347] [diagram] Replace `Size` and `Position` builders by `Size#of` and `Position#at`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/378[#378] [core] Make the stereotype description editing contex aware. As a result, the `IStereotypeDescriptionService` and some related classes are now manipulating an extra parameter in some methods, the `editingContextId`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/368[#368] [core] Remove the now useless `PreDestroyPayload`
- [properties] Remove the `PropertiesEventProcessor` which has never been used. Both the properties and the form representation are using the `FormEventProcessor`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/357[#357] [core] Remove the `SubscriptionDescription` and use instead the Spring `SecurityContextHolder` to retrieve the user subscribing to a reactive flux. As a result, this change will give us the ability to use much more easily other GraphQL integration in Spring such as Netflix DGS
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/268[#268] [core] Dispose instances of `IEditingContextEventProcessor` when they are not used anymore. This change introduce some minor evolutions to the API of `IDisposablePublisher` and `IEditingContextEventProcessorRegistry` which can impact any custom `IRepresentationEventProcessor`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/377[#377] [graphql] Rename the `projectEvent` subscription to `editingContextEvent`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/382[#382] [diagram] Switch the type of the label identifier from `String` to `UUID`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/384[#384] [explorer] Make the child creation descriptions editing context aware in order to leverage the domain to compute the childs
- [core] Remove the now useless `Subscriber` component
- [compatibility] Remove the now useless `CanCreateMappingTester` and `ToolDescriptionQuery`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/386[#386] [graphql] Make the representation creation editing context aware. This will move the field `representationDescriptions` on the editing context in the GraphQL schema
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/333[#333] [core] Make `IEditService#findClass` editing context aware
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/402[#402] [core] Remove all views from Sirius Components. Sirius Components will stop trying to provide a complete product but it will instead be used as a framework which can be used to build collaborative graphical applications. As a result, the views have been removed and most of them been transferred to Sirius Web.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/473[#473] [explorer] Improve the support for the read only workbench. This change introduce some API changes in several key workbench components such as `PropertiesWebSocketContainer`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/449[#449] [core] Move the navigation bar to MaterialUI. This change also removes the `LoggedInNavbar` and introduces the `NavigationBar`
- [core] Remove the now useless components such as `Navbar`, `ErrorView`, `View`, `Go`, `UserStatus` and `Footer`
- [core] Remove the now useless hooks such as `useCapabilities`, `useBranding`, `useAuth`

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/402[#402] [core] Remove most dependencies to `sirius-web-services` and `sirius-web-services-api` in preparation of their removal from this repository
- [core] Remove the unused concept `IFrontendContribution`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/402[#402] [core] Move the import / export support out of `sirius-web-emf`

== v0.2.0 (2021-02-12)

Second major release of Sirius Components after the move to an open source project.

Sirius Components was the core part of the proprietary product Obeo Cloud Platform up until a couple months ago.
We have transfered in the Eclipse Foundation most of the code of Obeo Cloud Platform to become both Sirius Web and its core part Sirius Components which should be reusable in multiple applications.

In this release, we have made some major refactoring in order to separate some remaining business concern which are specific to Sirius Web from the core goals of Sirius Web.
These improvements are not complete and some of them will need to be improved down the road but the structure of the project is starting to be more visible.

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-007] Adopt stable identifiers for diagrams
- [ADR-008] Add support for incremental layout
- [ADR-009] Adopt a proper versioning strategy
- [ADR-010] Reduce the coupling of our collaborative support

=== Deprecation warning

- [core] The hook `useProject` will soon be removed. It's original goal was to provide the ability to subscribe to a project related subscription but this subscription has never really been used. It was way too much used to simply fetch a project while this could be done with way less dependencies
- [core] Any usage of `projectId` in the collaborative parts or in the representation related code will be removed in the upcoming months
- [core] All frontend code using our custom React widgets such as `Button`, `Text`, `Spacing`, `Checkbox` etc will be modified to use MaterialUI instead
- [core] All frontend code using custom made state machines instead of XState based ones will be migrated to XState

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Introduce the `sirius-web-core-api` project and move some core concepts from the services API into the new core API project such as `IEditingContext`, `IPayload` and `IInput`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Introduce the `sirius-web-services` project and move some business related concepts like `Document`, `Project` and `ProjectService` out of the collaborative projects
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the dependency to the persistence from the collaborative API
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the `Context` concept which was used to propagate the authenticated principal to the business code. It was given to more than 70 classes while used by only a couple of them. On top of that, Spring's `SecurityContextHolder` can perform the same job with a much lower coupling. This will help reduce the coupling between the collaborative parts and the services API
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the useless `IProjectInput` and replace its usage with `IInput`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove all dependencies to `sirius-web-services-api` from `sirius-web-collaborative-api`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the `ProjectRenamedEventPayload` to allow us to prepare the future deletion of the `useProject` hook and the complete removal of business concerns from the collaborative layer
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Rename the `ProjectEventProcessor` to `EditingContextEventProcessor`. This concept and its registry have been made independent of `Project`. Those concepts will stop relying on a `projectId` but an `editingContextId` instead even if in practice this variable will still contain the value of `projectId` for now.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the method `IEditingContext#getDomain`. This method will now only be available on the EMF specific version of the `IEditingContect`. This contraint was not usefull for alternate implementations
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Move the `RenameRepresentationInput` to the `sirius-web-collaborative-api and `IObjectService` to the `sirius-web-core-api`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [explorer] Use `editingContextId` instead of `projectId` in the explorer
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [properties] Move properties related services to form related projects
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [diagram] Remove the dependency to `sirius-web-services-api` in `sirius-web-spring-collaborative-diagrams` thanks to the introduction of two new projects `sirius-web-diagrams-services-api` and `sirius-web-diagrams-services`. These two new projects are used to allow someone else to use a different persistence strategy for the diagrams. It will need to be refined but this solution allows us to isolate our dependency to the IRepresentationRepository
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/292[#292] [workbench] Restructure the components used by the workbench to make it reusable by consumers of Sirius Components. Components such as `DiagramWebSocketContainer` and `PropertiesWebSocketContainer` have thus been modified. In order to make it easier to reuse a Sirius Components workbench a component named `Workbench` has been created and new types such as `Selection`, `Representation` and `WorkbenchProps` have been introduced
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/303[#303] [business] Remove the link to modelers from the project context menu. Since we will not have time to fix the modelers before the release, we will not show this feature to end users and instead remove links to the modeler related pages

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/256[#256] [emf] Add support for composed images for `IObjectService#getImage`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/220[#220] [core] Add a basic support for the creation and edition of modelers
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/131[#131] [diagram] Add feedback to diagrams to indicate that tools cannot be applied
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/232[#232] [diagram] Add first support for incremental layout
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/153[#153] [workbench] Add the ability to close representations by adding a MaterialUI tabbar to display representations
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/293[#293] [workbench] Lower the coupling between the workbench and representations by introducing the `RepresentationContext` and the type `RepresentationComponentProps` for all representation components which replaces types such as `DiagramWebSocketContainerProps`. The `RepresentationContext` can be used to contribute additional representations to the Sirius Components workbench.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/296[#296] [core] Introduce the `ServerContext` in order to customize the URL of the server used by the frontend components. This will allow consumers of Sirius Components to specify a different `httpOrigin` to organize their frontend and backend in a very different manner

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/252[#252] [diagram] Improve the TypeScript typing of the `DiagramWebSocketContainer` with the introduction of `Selection` and a dedicated `DiagramWebSocketContainerProps`
- [releng] Trigger the build on any pull requests regardless of their origin
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/283[#283] [graphql] Add the `EditingContext` to the GraphQL API
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/261[#261] [emf] Improve the perform of the `DocumentService` by removing some useless loading and serializing steps of EMF resources
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/238[#238] [diagram] Migrate the `DiagramWebSocketContainer` to XState and MaterialUI

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/278[#278] [diagram] Ensure that we are always sending the latest diagram state and not the initial state when new users subscribe to an already opened diagram
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/295[#295] [diagram] Fix a bug which could lead to the creation of a diagram containing labels with the same identifier
