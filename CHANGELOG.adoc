=== Deprecation warning

- The type `RenameProjectSuccessPayload` and `DeletedProjectSuccessPayload` will be replaced by `SuccessPayload`
- The type `DeleteRepresentationSuccessPayload` will be replaced by `SuccessPayload`
- The mutation `createRepresentation` and `deleteRepresentation` and their datafetcher will be entirely managed by Sirius Components
- The interface `IEditingContextEPackageService` should be deleted since we now have access to editing context preprocessors which can be used to contribute packages to editing context and even more.
- Remove the image for resources from `sirius-components-compatibility` and `org.eclipse.sirius.components.compatibility.services.ImageConstants`.

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3010[#3010] [forms] Reference widget has been updated.
On backend side, `clickHandler` has been removed from `ReferenceValue`.
`itemClickHandlerProvider` has been removed from `ReferenceWidgetDescription`.
EventHandler & DataFetcher on widget reference item click action have also been deleted.
The reference widget graphql schema and the frontend have been updated accordingly.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2822[#2822] [diagram] The GraphQL type `Edge` must now implement `labelEditable` boolean field.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2783[#2783] [diagram] Remove the package `sirius-components-diagrams` containing the Sprotty based implementation of our diagrams
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2783[#2783] [diagram] Rename the package `sirius-components-diagrams-reactflow` to `sirius-components-diagrams` since we only have one implementation now
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2783[#2783] [diagram] Remove the modules `sirius-components-diagrams-layout-api` and `sirius-components-diagrams-layout` in favor of the frontend based layout API.
As a result, all the APIs relying on this code have been deleted too such as the dead code used to export diagrams on the server or the API for parametric SVGs which was replaced in Reactflow based diagrams.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3020[#3020] [sirius-web] Remove the component `Views` and its dependencies in favor of a more straightforward API.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2823[#2823] [diagram] Some changes have been made for node layout, there may be an impact on the custom node.
* `getNodeOrMinWidth` and `getNodeOrMinHeight` have been renamed `getDefaultOrMinWidth` and `getDefaultOrMinHeight`.
* `computePreviousSize` no longer returns `{0,0}` when it's a new node but its default size.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2606[#2606] [diagram] Add the attributes `topGap` and `bottomGap` to graphql `ListLayoutStrategy`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3042[#3042] [core] IObjectService have been divided in smaller API IContentService, IObjectSearchService, IIdentityService and ILabelService.
If you used the default implementation of `IObjectService` you can still use it to retrieve the default implementation of the new services.
Yet we are recommending using each individual services since this aggregated one may be deprecated in the future.
If you want to add your own custom behavior, please use the new services, see the related ADR for more details.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3066[#3066] [core] `IObjectSearchService`, `IIdentityService`, `ILabelService` now can also find/resolve representations.
This changes a core assumption from before where an element known to those services (i.e. an element for which `IIdentityService.getId` returned a non-null value) was a "semantic element" and thus *could not be* a representation.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3021[#3021] [sirius-web] Remove the interfaces `IRepresentationDescriptionRegistry` and `IRepresentationDescriptionRegistryConfigurer` to replace them with `IEditingContextRepresentationDescriptionProvider` which provides the same feature but also gives access to the editing context for conditional registration of representation descriptions.
This new interface will move in the near future from `sirius-components-core` to `sirius-web-application`.
It's current location is only there to simplify the transition to the new Sirius Web architecture.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3021[#3021] [sirius-web] Make the `ISuggestedRootObjectTypesProvider` optional in `sirius-components-emf` in order to be able to reuse this maven module without the Sirius Desktop compatibility one.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3019[#3019] [emf] Remove the dependency from `sirius-components-emf` to the validation representation.
Reusing the EMF compatibility layer will not add any dependency to specific representations.
The EMF validation support will now be provided by `sirius-web-services`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3156[#3156] [core] In our GraphQL schema, `Viewer` is now a type instead of an interface.
Having `Viewer` as a type did not bring any additional value and it created some overhead by having to create and keep updated an additional type without any benefit.
- [sirius-web] The field `ChangeKind.PROJECT_RENAMING` has been deleted since it does not make any sense in Sirius Components.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2713[#2713] [diagram] Add the attribute `growableNodeIds` to graphql `ListLayoutStrategy`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3019[#3019] [core] Add `CoreImageConstants.DEFAULT_SVG` to retrieve the default svg image from `sirius-components-core` instead of the now deleted `ImageConstants.DEFAULT_SVG` from `sirius-components-compatibility`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3019[#3019] [core] Move the `WidgetIdProvider` from `sirius-components-compatibility` to `sirius-components-forms` to remove unnecessary dependencies to the Sirius Desktop compatibility layer.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3019[#3019] [core] Move the EMF based default description of the details view from `sirius-components-compatibility-emf` to `sirius-components-emf-forms` since there are no dependency between the default description of the details view and the Sirius Desktop compatibility layer.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3096[#3096] [tree] `TreeConfiguration` has a new parameter `List<String> activeFilterIds`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3019[#3019] [form] Allow consumers of Sirius Components to reuse the reference widget without the form description editor or the view DSL.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3246[#3246] [view] Remove representation specific code from `ViewRepresentationDescriptionSearchService`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3250[#3250] [form] Change the base package of the reference widget from `org.eclipse.sirius.components.widgets.reference` to `org.eclipse.sirius.components.widgets.reference.view`


=== Dependency update

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2783[#2783] [diagram] Remove our dependency to Sprotty and Snabbdom
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/3105[#3105] [deck] Move to @ObeoNetwork/react-trello 2.4.11 to avoid warnings because of react-redux depending on react 16.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2804[#2804] [sirius-web] Add the ability to declare custom nodes while using the `sirius-web-application` frontend package.
A new optional component named `DiagramRepresentationConfiguration` has been introduced.
If you want to add some custom nodes, this new component must be declared under `SiriusWebApplication`:
```ts
const nodeTypeRegistry: NodeTypeRegistry = {
  ...
};
<SiriusWebApplication httpOrigin={httpOrigin} wsOrigin={wsOrigin}>
  <DiagramRepresentationConfiguration nodeTypeRegistry={nodeTypeRegistry} />
</SiriusWebApplication>
```
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2790[#2790] [diagram] All handles used to resize a node have been updated to be wider, you can update your custom nodes in the same way it's done in the EllipseNode example.

The GraphQL type `NodeDescription` has a new field `borderNodeDescriptionIds`, returning a list of Ids and replacing the field `borderNodeDescriptions` which has been deleted.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2872[#2872] [diagram] Change the signature of the node converters in order to leverage the diagram description to resolve the reuse descriptions.
Additional changes to this interface will probably occur in the near future in order to support more complex use cases.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2889[#2889] [emf] Remove the default implementation of the editing context from the `sirius-components-emf` module.

== v2023.12.0

=== Shapes

- Add support for custom nodes in Diagram representations
- Add the possibility to specify a size ratio on node.
- Add support for rotatable border node
- Improve handles management in React Flow based diagrams

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-111] Add support for image overlay
- [ADR-112] Provide only valid view descriptions to the renderer
- [ADR-113] Add support for multiple IObjectService
- [ADR-114] Add support for multiple IEditService
- [ADR-115] Split the Sirius Web frontend
- [ADR-116] Add support for changing the content of the explorer
- [ADR-117] Add support for changing the content of the details view

- [ADR-119] Share layout data between subscribers
- [ADR-120] Improve the arrange all action with reactflow
- [ADR-121] Add process before and after input handling

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2386[#2386] [form] Reference widget structure has changed, `referenceOptions` has been removed to be lazily loaded.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2329[#2335] [form] The general mutation `editReference` has been removed from the reference widget. This mutation has been replaced by finer grain mutations:
** _clearReference_ mutation: to reset the content references (set the value to `null` for mono-valued references and to an empty list for multi-valued ones).
** _addReferenceValues_ mutation: to several reference values to a reference (only used with multi-valued references)
** _setReferenceValue_ mutation: to set the value of mono-valued references
** _removeReferenceValue_ mutation: to remove a given value from a reference (in case of mono-valued references, this mutation is equivalent to _clearReference_)
** _createElementInReference_ mutation: to create a new element (used in the context of a reference widget)
** _moveReferenceValue_ mutation: to reorder the list of values in multi-valued references

UI is unchanged except that we removed the transactional behavior of the _TransferModal_ component which is now performing operations live. This means that changes are no longer done when the modal is close (using the _Apply_ button) but as soon as the user interacts with elements (adding or removing values, changing order).

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2269[#2269] [core] The GraphQL field `EditingContext#domains` has been modified.
A new parameter `rootDomainsOnly: Boolean` has been added, allowing to remove domains not compatible with root objects.
For example, Diagram & Form domains are not root domains because `DiagramDescription` and `FormDescription` are not root objects valid candidates.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/1712[#1712] [diagram] The GraphQL type `Node` must now implement `isLabelEditable` boolean field.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2456[#2456] [sirius-web] The GraphQL field `CreateChildSuccessPayload` now expects to have a list of messages.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/1982[#1982] [diagram] Change the diagram structure. The Node's 'label' attribute has been renamed into 'insideLabel' and its type changed from `Label` to `InsideLabel` (which is currently identical to `Label` except for the name).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2388[#2388] [core] The `IObjectService.getImagePath` API changed and now must return a list containing all the image paths to compose/overlay.
Due to this data structure modification, all existing diagrams can no longer be opened.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2460[#2460] [form] The reference widget no longer declares a `createElementHandlerProvider`, this feature is delegated to the new service `IReferenceWidgetCreateElementHandler`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2453[#2453] [diagram] The GraphQL fields `DeleteFromDiagramSuccessPayload`, `EditLabelSuccessPayload` and `DropOnDiagramSuccessPayload` now expects to have a list of messages.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2514[#2514] [diagram] Move and rename the RectangleNodeStyle `withHeader` attribute to InsideLabel `isHeader`.
It requires to add a `isHeaderProvider` to the _LabelDescription_ of Node.
Replace only for the programmatic API the _LabelDescription_ type in _NodeDescription_ by _InsideLabelDescription_ and add the inside label location.
Update the graphql API accordingly.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2444[#2444] [form] `ViewFormDescriptionConverterSwitch` now extends `FormSwitch<Optional<AbstractControlDescription>>`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2516[#2516] [diagram] Add to the diagram core API the possibility to display the header separator when the inside label is a header.
It requires to add a `displayHeaderSeparatorProvider` to the _InsideLabelDescription_.
For the compatibility layer, the separator will always be displayed if the label is inside a node displaying its children has a list.
Add the attribute `displayHeaderSeparator` to the graphql API.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2535[#2535] [view] Add the possibility for the header separator to be displayed or hidden in the View DSL.
+
.Compartment with header without separator
image:doc/screenshots/compartmentWithHeaderWithoutSeparator.png[Compartment with header without separator,30%]
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2255[#2255] [diagram] The properties `widthComputationExpression` and `heightComputationExpression` have been removed from `NodeStyleDescription`.
From now on, use the `defaultWidthExpression` and `defaultHeightExpression` properties from `NodeDescription`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2537[#2537] [sirius-web] `sirius-web` frontend package has been split in two: `sirius-web` and `sirius-web-application`.
The package `sirius-web` now depends on `sirius-web-application`.
A new component `SiriusWebApplication` has been added.
Developers who want to create a `sirius-web` frontend should use this component as their root component.
The API of this component will change over time in order to provide additional capabilities.
API breaks should be expected.
+
Another component, named `Views` has also been added.
This component will allow developers to customize some parts of the Sirius Web views.
It will currently provide the ability to customize the application icon and application menu.
The API of this component will also change over time so API breaks should be expected in the upcoming releases.
+
This new package and those new components are the first part of our work to make Sirius Web more reusable.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2615[#2615] [diagram] `useDropNode().dropFeedbackStyleProvider` has been removed.
Use `useDropNodeStyle(node.id)` instead to get the feedback of the drop feedback.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2671[#2671] [diagram] Switch to Reactflow by default.
To open a diagram with Sprotty, suffixes the diagram name with `__SPROTTY`

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2386[#2386] [form] Reference widget candidates are now lazily loaded when necessary.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2424[#2424] [view] Align the format of description id used in Form generated from View with the one used in diagram.
As a result, the identifier of a form description created from a view model will not be an UUID anymore but instead an URL based identifier
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2335[#2335] [form] Change the capabilities of the reference widget to open it to more customization.
In order to provide a first version of those capabilities, some additional coupling has been created between the reference widget and its use in Sirius Web which may prevent its use in other applications.
This coupling will be removed in the near future as a consequence, the dependencies of this code will change and some APIs of the reference widget will be broken in the near future.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2380[#2380] [diagram] Add typing to reactflow hooks
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2430[#2430] [diagram] Improve fit to screen feature to zoom on selected nodes

It is now possible to contribute specific services to interact with domain objects, through `IObjectServiceDelegate`.
The new implementation of `IObjectService`, named `ComposedObjectService`, tries first to delegate to the appropriate `IObjectServiceDelegate` and then fallback to a default behavior from `IDefaultObjectService` if needed.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2530[#2530] [core] Add support for multiple `IEditService`.
It is now possible to contribute specific services to edit domain objects, through `IEditServiceDelegate`.
The new implementation of `IEditService`, named `ComposedEditService`, tries first to delegate to the appropriate `IEditServiceDelegate` and then fallback to a default behavior from `IDefaultEditService` if needed.

- Add the possibility to contribute custom palette tools

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-107] Add support for dynamic and conditional widgets in Forms
- [ADR-108] Improve the widget id computation
- [ADR-109] Add support for transient data in forms
- [ADR-110] Color Management in View

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/2250[#2250] [core] Remove all references to notistack from `sirius-components-core`.
As a result, the link between notistack and Sirius Components needs to be updated in applications using Sirius Components.
See the Sirius Web `ToastProvider` and `ToastContextInitializer` to see how to give Sirius Components the relevant function(s) from notistack.
Without the dependency to notistack in `sirius-components-core`, it will be easier to leverage native VS Code popup to display our errors.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2259[#2259] [tree] [sirius-web] Move the `NewDocumentModal` and the `UploadDocumentModal` from `sirius-components-tree` to `sirius-web`.
We introduced the `TreeToolBarContribution` components to contribute actions to the `TreeToolBar` such as the `NewDocumentModal` and the `UploadDocumentModal`.
As a result, the `NewDocumentModal` and the `UploadDocumentModal` will not be available in applications.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2270[#2270] [core] [sirius-web] Move `DeleteProjectModal`, `NewObjectModal`, `NewRepresentationModal`, `NewRootObjectModal` and `RenameProjectModal` from `sirius-components` to `sirius-web``.
As a result, they will not be available in the Sirius Components packages anymore, and thus, applications that need such modals will need to implement them.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2274[#2274] [core] Remove the `Form` and `FormContainer` components.
They will not be provided by the `sirius-components` package anymore.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2276[#2276] [core] [sirius-web] Move the `ErrorBoundary` HOC into sirius-web.
It is not available for applications anymore, and thus, applications that need a global error handling strategy will need to implement it by themselves.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2279[#2279] [core] Remove the package `sirius-components`.
All of its remaining content was only relevant inside of Sirius Web and it has thus been migrated to this location
- [releng] Stop minifying the code of Sirius Components packages.
As a result the development of applications consuming Sirius Components packages will be easier and it will be the responsibility of the application to minify everything (which they should already be doing).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2296[#2296] [diagram] `sirius-components-diagrams-reactflow` now depends on `html-to-image` node package.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2236[#2236] [forms] The introduction of _ForDescription_ and _IfDescription_ elements to the Forms DSL introduced breaking changes in the metamodel.
Existing FormDescription documents will need to be modified to load correctly, and any custom widget's metamodel will need to be regenerated using the new `form.ecore` version as reference.
See [ADR-107] _Add support for dynamic and conditional widgets in Forms_ for the details of the changes.
Also, all widget descriptions now have a `Function<VariableManager, String> targetObjectIdProvider`, needed to compute the widget instance's id.
The new `targetObjectIdProvider` is required to be non-null, so any code which programmatically builds core Form Descriptions (not View-based ones), needs to pass a non-null provider.
A suitable implementation is to get the id of the `self` object using `IObjectService.getId()`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2118[#2118] [form] The introduction of the new modal for create objects with the reference widget, apply changes for two queries `rootObjectCreationDescriptions` and `childCreationDescriptions`.
It's now possible to provide _referenceKind_ to only get the `ChildCreationDescription` matching this _reference_.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2253[#2253] [diagram] The introduction of ToolSection in palette, change the _DiagramDescription_ structure by adding a new level _Palette_ instead of _[ToolSection]_.
Note that _palette_ will be removed in short-term from the _DiagramDescription_.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2329[#2329] [form] Split of `sirius-components-widget-reference` to extract EMF-related code into a new module `sirius-components-collaborative-widget-reference`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2252[#2252] [diagram] The support for React Flow based diagrams now require a `DiagramPaletteToolContext` in order to contribute custom palette tool.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2343[#2343] [sirius-web] Add iconURL field on `ChildCreationDescription` type.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2371[#2371] [view] Colors are now required everywhere.
We will not hardcoded decisions in our application, instead all the references to a color should be configured.
In the near future, the GraphQL schema and the frontend of `sirius-components-forms` will thus be updated to reflect this new change.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2371[#2371] [sirius-web] Default colors are now loaded from a default model located in `sirius-components-view/src/main/resources/studioColorPalettes.json`.
They are loaded in every studio project but hidden in the explorer.
They are also made readonly in the details view.
Applications derived from Sirius Web may have to ensure that references to default colors are properly resolved when loading a view model.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2191[#2191] [view] The Color property on ImageNodeStyle has been removed.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2388[#2388] [tree] `treeItem` is no longer composed of a single string for the imageURL, but of a list of strings to take into account composite images.
The `IObjectService.getImagePath` API changed and now must return a list containing all the image paths.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2789[#2789] [diagram] Added the file ReactFlow.css to sirius-web package.

=== New Features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2185[#2185] [diagram] Add support for drop tool from the explorer with React Flow.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2117[#2117] [form] Add a modal to select new values for multi-valued references
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2118[#2118] [form] Add a modal to create new objects on a widget reference
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2253[#2253] [diagram] Add the possibility of organizing palette tools into sections
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2236[#2236] [forms] It is now possible to use `For` and `If` constructs inside the definition of Form (currently only inside _Groups_ and _Flexbox containers_).
Both constructs are commonly combined together, with e.g. _For_ iterating on the different features of the current semantic element and several _If_ inside the loop to decide which concrete widget(s) to instantiate depending on the feature's type.
They can however also be used independently (e.g. a single _If_ outside of a _For_ to make the presence of a widget conditional) and combined in arbitrary ways (e.g. nested loops or conditionals).
Note that this first version has a known limitation: _FormDescriptions_ which use _For_ or _If_ elements can not be reliably edited using the _Form Description Editor_.
This will be fixed in the next version.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2254[#2254] [diagram] Add the possibility to specify precondition on diagram tools
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web/issues/2252[#2252] [diagram] It's now possible to contribute custom frontend-defined tools in a React Flow diagram palette.

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/2080[#2080] [tree] EditingContextRepresentationDataFetcher will filter on IRepresentation instead of ISemanticRepresentation to be able to support TreeDescription.
+
As such targetObjectId is removed from RepresentationMetadata.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/2124[#2124] [sirius-web,emf] The `org.eclipse.sirius.web.services.documents.DocumentMetadataAdapter` has been renamed `ResourceMetadataAdapter` and moved to the `org.eclipse.sirius.components.emf` package (in `sirius-components-emf`).
This allows for code which does not depend on Sirius Web and the Document notion to properly display the top-level elements of a project in the UI.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/2126[#2126] [tree] The `IExplorerDescriptionProvider` interface has been removed.
The `TreeDescription` used by the _Explorer_ view is now registered using the general `IRepresentationDescriptionRegistryConfigurer` (see `ExplorerDescriptionProvider`).

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1988[#1988] All Form widgets can now define (if relevant) a dynamically computed "help text".
Widgets which define such a help text have a new "?" icon next to their labels; the actual help text is accessible as a tooltip on this icon.
For View-based widgets, this materializes as an AQL `helpExpression`.
The help text can include multiple lines (separated by `\n`), but no text formatting.
+
image:doc/images/Widget_Help_Tooltip.png[Example of a help tooltip on a widget]
+
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/2048[#2048] [diagram] Add a basic support for the resize.
It is possible to reduce the size of a node less than the space needed to display all children.

These should be registered globally like other representations using a `IRepresentationDescriptionRegistryConfigurer`.
Their `TreeDescription.getCanCreatePredicate()` will be invoked with a `treeId` variable (a string) to test if it handles a given tree subscription requested by the front.
For example the main _Explorer_ frontend component subscribes to the `treeEvent` subscription with a `treeId` of `'explorer://'`, and the backend `ExplorerDescriptionProvider`'s tests for `treeId.startsWith("explorer://")` to indicate it is the one to use to handle this subscription.

All the colors are now defined in a new palette object _ColorPalette_ with the properties _name_ and _value_.
A view can define as many _ColorPalette_ as desired.
In the _styleDescription_, the definition of a color are now a select list of all the colors contained in the _ColorPalette_ of the view
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1970[#1970] [diagram] Simplify the lifecycle of the diagram creation and refresh.
For that, the `DiagramCreationService` will have less responsibilities.
Starting now, it will stop persisting the diagram after its creation.
It will start by improving a bit performances since diagrams were persisted twice in some use cases.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1915[#1915] [view] Add the page support in the view DSL.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/2018[#2018] [formdescriptioneditors] Fixed form editor selection to display the page containing the first element selected.

=== New Features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1883[#1883] [sirius-web] Add the possibility to programmatically set some metadata such as specifics natures to a project.
These natures can be used later to enable or not some capabilities on a project.
This work will start by adding the ability to filter the project's domains.
A large set of features will have to be updated in order to stop considering the list of metamodels available in an editing context as a certainty.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1946[#1946] Enabled child extenders in the View DSL implementation.
This allows downstream projects and applications to provide their own sub-types of the DSL types (e.g. new WidgetDescriptions).
In addition to registering the extension metamodel itself, users must provide a `ChildExtenderProvider` bean for their extensions to be properly integrated.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1918[#1918] [tree] Its is now possible to filter tree items in trees.
After selected a tree item, hit Ctrl+f (or Cmd+f on macOS) to enable the filter bar.
+
image:doc/screenshots/filterBar.png[Filter Bar,30%,30%]
+
All visible tree items containing the value typed in the filter bar will be highlighted.
The filter button inside the filter bar allows to filter (hide) all visible tree items not containing the value typed in the filter bar.
+
image:doc/screenshots/filterBarFilterButton.png[Filter Bar Filter Button,30%,30%]
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1914[#1914] [form] It is now possible for applications to provide their own custom widgets without forking Sirius Components.
See link:doc/how-to/contribute-custom-widget.adoc[the documentation] for more details.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1830[#1830] [layout] This feature is experimental and can be activated on a diagram by adding "__EXPERIMENTAL" to its name.
The new algorithm does the minimum possible to place node without overlap.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1985[|#1985] [sirius-web] It is now possible to use in-memory View-based representations by registering them in the new `InMemoryViewRegistry`.
These representations can be created programmatically or loaded from `.view` EMF models on startup, and do not need to be stored as documents inside a project in the database.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1921[#1921] [view] Added a project sirius-components-view-builder.
+
Introducing providers interfaces to help creating view programmatically.
+
Introducing a generator of builders aimed to help creating view programmatically, the generation makes use of emf-merge and modifications to these builders can be annotated to live during future regeneration.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1912[#1912] [core] Add the possibility to send feedback messages to the frontend after an action.

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1869[#1869] [tree] Navigate to the first child with the right arrow if a node is expanded.
Navigate to the parent with the left arrow if a node is collapsed
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1621[#1621] [project] Migrate the onboard area to Material-UI
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1852[#1852] [layout] Single position event takes the diagram element id and the double position event takes the source id and target id
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1971[#1971] [layout] Add the first new layout engine integration test
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1831[#1831] [layout] Improve the data structure of the layout algorithm
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1975[#1975] [emf] The getContents method from the ObjectService will use the eObject's IEditingDomainItemProvider if it exists.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1916[#1916] [sirius-web] We supply an example of how to provide your own _Details_ view definition for specific elements using a View-based FormDescription.
See `org.eclipse.sirius.web.sample.configuration.DomainPropertiesConfigurer` and `org.eclipse.sirius.web.sample.services.DomainAttributeServices` for a working example that can be easily adapted.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/2003[#2003] [view] Make reconnection tool more robust for applications which use a custom IViewRepresentationDescriptionSearchService.

== v2023.4.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-094] Provide better control on contextual palette's content
- [ADR-095] Use richer data types in the View DSL definition
- [ADR-096] Distinguish the containment kind of view creation requests
- [ADR-097] Separate the layout data structures from the diagram data structures

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1643[1643] [core] Removed our dependencies to Spring Security
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1592[#1592] [view] In View-based diagram definition, all tools applicable on a given element are now configured inside the new _Palette_ element directly inside the element (diagram, node or edge) description.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1761[#1761] [core] Remove `sirius-web-graphql-schema` since it was not really used anymore
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1825[#1825] [diagram] Distinguish the containment kind of view creation requests
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1840[#1840] [diagram] The GraphQL field Diagram#autoLayout has been removed.
We only use DiagramDescription#autoLayout to retrieve the autolayout state of a diagram.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1638[#1638] [view] The lifecycle of the representation descriptions from the view DSL is now aligned with the lifecycle of the metamodels computed from the Domain DSL.
+
As such, the representation descriptions available for an `EditingContext` are now computed and transformed when the `EditingContext` is loaded.
It will thus improve the performances of the lookup for representation descriptions since they will be referenced directly by the `EditingContext`.
This does not come with any changes to the interface `IEditingContext`.
Alternate implementations of `IEditingContext` do not have to keep the representation descriptions in their implementation of `IEditingContext`.
+
By loading representation descriptions from the View DSL when the editing context is being loaded, we are making the editing context the sole source of truth of the representation descriptions available.
+
As a result, any datafetcher requiring a representation description will now have to use the editing context event processor registry to find the requested representation description.
We previously had some datafetcher which were using the `IRepresentationDescriptionSearchService`` with `null` as a value for the editing context.
Such calls will not work anymore since `null` will not be an acceptable value anymore by our implementation of this interface.
- [diagram] Changed the type of `Node#descriptionId` and `Edge#descriptionId` from `UUID` to `String`
- [view] Changed the values of {Diagram|Node|Edge}descriptionId computed by the view converter:
** `siriusComponents://diagramDescription?sourceKind=view&sourceId=UUID_OF_DOCUMENT&sourceElementId=UUID_OF_SOURCE_ELEMENT`
** `siriusComponents://nodeDescription?sourceKind=view&sourceId=UUID_OF_DOCUMENT&sourceElementId=UUID_OF_SOURCE_ELEMENT`
** `siriusComponents://edgeDescription?sourceKind=view&sourceId=UUID_OF_DOCUMENT&sourceElementId=UUID_OF_SOURCE_ELEMENT`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1890[#1890]  [view] Tools are now retrieved from their corresponding View Description
+
Removing dependencies from sirius-components-compatibility-emf in the canHandle methods of sirius-components-view-emf services

This debug mode can be activated by setting the configuration property `sirius.components.diagram.debug` to `true`.
Once activated, this debug mode will display additional information on diagram elements to help debug what has been computed by the backend.
image:doc/images/Debug_info.png[]
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1902[#1902] [sirius-web] Add new data fetchers to sirius-web allowing to execute AQL requests

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/593[#593] [domain] Add support for referencing and extending other custom domains
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1518[#1518] [project] Remove the "format all code" save action in order to let us write code without having to specify "@formatter:off" everywhere. It will also make it easier for us to use IDEs other than Eclipse to contribute to Sirius Web
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1632[#1632] [core] Start documenting the variables available for each operation in our various representations
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1565[1565] [view] The definition of the View DSL now uses richer data types for most attributes.
This has no visible effect at the moment, but will allow better documentation, validation and configuration later.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1879[#1879] [core] Add an annotation `@Builder` to identify builders and simplify some use cases involving the builder pattern.
It is now possible to use builders in records and it is a first step toward the deprecation of the `@Immutable` annotation in favor of more records.
- [diagram] Added a common interface `IDiagramElement` that is implemented by `Node` and `Edge`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1904[#1904] [project] Add templates to track our work on shapes and scopes in `doc/iterations/YYYY-MM/{scopes/scope.adoc|shapes/shape.adoc}`.
At the end of every iteration, we will work on the shape of the new iterations and validate them by merging a first version.
+
During the iteration, while developers will progress on their work, they will update the scope.
We will not create a new commit for each minor change in the scope, instead the scope will evolve while a pull request is updated.
The progress on a task could thus be shared with a draft pull request with the rest of the team.

- [backend] Switch to EMFJson 2.3.4
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1496[#1496] [layout] Switch to ELK 0.8.1

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1374[#1374] [layout] The border node position is now updated when its parents bounds has changed (e.g. when a node increases its size because of a child creation).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1580[#1580] [diagram] Border nodes do not return to their previous position after they have been moved manually.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1522[#1522] [diagram] Rectangle nodes with a header can now be resized.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1529[#1529] [diagram] Improve the layout of newly created edges with a begin or end label

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1692[#1692] [core] JPEG images where previously ignored if using a `.jpg` extension instead of `.jpeg`.
They are now correctly supported
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1741[#1741] [diagram] Border node placement specified with ELK configuration not taken into account anymore
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1720[#1720] [diagram] Fix the position where newly created views appear on a diagram after a drop

=== New Features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1567[#1567] [project] Add support for project templates.
Project templates are defined in the backend using the `IProjectTemplateProvider` (template metadata) and `IProjectTemplateInitializer` (project contents) interfaces.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1456[#1456] [diagram] Add the ability to filter the edge created using some graphical variables
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1456[#1456] [view] Add a precondition expression to the edge description
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1463[#1463] [diagram] Add support for the direct edit of the start and end labels of an edge. Two new tools can be defined on an edge in order to specify how the begin and end labels can be edited.
+
image:doc/images/View_edit_begin_and_end_labels.png[width=491,height=285]
+
For each of those tools, `Edit Begin Label` and `Edit End Label` in the previous screenshot, the specifier can also enter an `Initial Direct Edit Label Expression` which will be used to compute the initial value of the label when the edition will be triggered.
This is mostly used to support the edition of computed labels.
The variables `semanticEdgeSource` and `semanticEdgeTarget` are now available both in the `Initial Direct Edit Label Expression` and while evaluating the behavior of the tools themselves.
+
image:doc/images/View_edit_begin_label_initial_expression.png[width=522,height=224]
+
In order to edit a begin or end label of an edge, it is necessary to double click on said label.
Using `F2`` will trigger the edition of the center label of the edge.
+
image:doc/images/View_edit_begin_label_in_action.png[width=550,height=234]
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1496[#1496] [layout] Add the support for free form compartment.
+
image:doc/images/Free_form_layout_in_a_list_layout.png[A node with three free form compartment]

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1624[#1624] [diagram] Add support for expand/collapse of nodes.
A node can be collapsed or expanded if its view description is collapsible or if its sirius desktop description is a region (Horizontal or Vertical stack).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1624[#1624] [diagram] The `collapsingState` of a node is now available as a variable to compute its style.
As a result, it is possible to create a conditional style which will use the collapsing state quite easily.
Using the view DSL, one can use the expression `aql:collapsingState.toString() = 'COLLAPSED'` as a condition to create a style which will be used when the node is collapsed.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1584[#1584] [diagram] Studio makers can indicate whether or not a node type can be resized by the end-user or not.
Nodes which can not be resized (or have not been resized yet) have their actual size computed from the NodeDescription's sizeProvider in a uniform way for all node types.
Nodes which can and *have* been resized keep their user-chosen size across both incremental and full layout (as long as the requested size is compatible with other constraints).

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1583[#1583] [diagram] Add support for diagram nodes labels' auto-wrap
+
image:doc/images/Diagram_node_labels_auto_wrap.png[width=517,height=424]
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1588[#1588] [tree] Add support for enabling/disabling the synchronization between the explorer and the current selection.
When it is enabled, if the current selection is not visible in the explorer, it will be revealed by expanding the relevant tree items.
On the other hand, when it is disabled, the selection will be visible in the explorer but no tree items will be automatically expanded.


=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1559[#1559] [view] It is now possible to specify the (computed) width and height separately for a _Node Style_ (instead of a single size before, which always resulted in square shapes).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1560[#1560] Remove unused `EditingContextCompletionProposalsDataFetcher`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1426[#1426] [view] Add missing data type on initialDirectEditLabelExpression
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1456[#1456] [diagram] Add new methods to the diagram rendering cache to compute the parent, ancestors, children and descendants of a given node identifier
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1574[#1574] [diagram] Single click tools can now be executed on Edges in addition to Nodes
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1569[#1569] [view] Only delegate semantic deletion to the element's _Delete Tool_
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1562[#1562] [view] The default/canonical behaviors for diagram elements can now be invoked explicitly from AQL expressions. See `org.eclipse.sirius.components.view.emf.CanonicalServices`. This feature will be used only for internal for now. There will be breaking changes on this topic soon.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1596[#1596] [diagram] Sirius Web now includes two example parametric SVG images named "Package" and "Class".
They can be used as any custom image (e.g. in a View-based diagram), but their precise shape is partially computed on the backend, in this case to adjust the size of the label compartment to the actual label's width.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1563[#1563] [view] If a diagram description does not explicitly configure a delete/direct edit/element creation tool, the corresponding behavior is simply disabled.
By default, new nodes, edges and tools are explicitly configured to invoke the default canonical behavior; it is just made explicit in the model and can now serve as a based or removed to disable the behavior.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1558[#1558] [diagram] When a diagram is read-only, the following actions are now disabled: _Arrange All_, _Reveal hidden_ and _Reveal faded_ elements, and triggering direct edit or delete from the keyboard.

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1401[#1401] [tree] The setSelection is called even if the selection did not changed

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1482[#1482] [core] Allow CustomImageLoader to get images from packaged projects. To import images from local files on startup, set `-Dorg.eclipse.sirius.web.customImages.pattern="file:///local/path/to/folder/with/files/**"`. To import images from a folder inside a packaged JAR, use `-Dorg.eclipse.sirius.web.customImages.pattern="classpath:path/in/jar/**"`. The syntax supports Ant-style path patterns.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1517[#1517] [core] Remove the error for strings which are not marked as non-externalized

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1386[#1386] [project] Users can now upload their own images from a project's new settings page (available in the project menu). These images can be displayed in forms using the new image widget, or in View-based diagrams using and ImageNodeStyleDescription and selecting the image in the list of available shapes.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1457[#1457] [diagram] Make possible to provide an expression on the label edit tool in View DSL to initialize the direct edit label text field. We kept the current behavior for the compatibility layer but, _in fine_ it will be possible to leverage the direct edit tool _Input Label Expression_ to initialize the direct edit label text field.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1346[#1346] [forms] Add support for a Rich Text edition widget. The widget behaves in a similar way to the existing Textfield and Textarea widgets, except that the text value should be valid Markdown, and can be edited in a WYSIWYG way by the end user.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1428[#1428] [layout] Add support for List layout compartment. We rely on the layout strategy engine handler switch and the layout engine handler switch to dispatch to the correct behavior depending on how children should be laid out and the type of the node. This kind of architecture has already been implemented for model operation for the View DSL. Nothing has changed if nodes have to be laid out freely.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1439[#1439] [form] Add support for toolbar actions in Form/FormDescriptionEditor
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1437[#1437] [form] Add support for styles preview in FormDescriptionEditor

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1064[#1064] [core] Remove the URL utility file and ask for the `httpOrigin` instead. Consumers of Sirius Components which rely on the behavior of the URL utility file should instead maintain their own utility file since it is dependent on our build technology and development process.

=== Dependency update

- [backend] Switch to EMFJson 2.3.2-SNAPSHOT. It contains better management of proxy resolution in case of intermodel references

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1368[#1368] [diagram] Do not render rectangle view children twice

While using the Sirius desktop VSM you can define a tool to do both target and source reconnection, you will need to define a tool to reconnect the source and another one to reconnect the target using the View DSL

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-067] Add support for injecting platform services/beans into Java service classes used by studios
- [ADR-068] Improve support for precondition expression from representation description

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1311[#1311] [releng] Allow reusing `sirius-components-emf` without dependencies to the domain or view DSL. As a result, two new projects `sirius-components-domain-emf` and `sirius-components-view-emf` have been introduced in order to connect the EMF compatibility layer with the domain and view DSL. Consumers of `sirius-components-emf` may have to update their import. The behavior of the code has not been modified
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1311[#1311] [releng] Allow reusing `sirius-component-emf` without dependencies to Sirius Desktop. As a result, a new project `sirius-components-compatibility-emf` has been added in order to provide EMF support for the Sirius desktop compatibility layer. Consumers of `sirius-components-emf` may have to update their import. The behavior of the code has not been modified
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1237[#1237] [releng] Remove the two hardcoded dependencies to Spring MVC from Sirius Components. As such, reusing most components from Sirius Components without Spring MVC will be easier. The only projects with a dependency to Spring MVC are located in the `web` package
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1312[#1312] [graphql] Provide the datafetchers used by the representations. Starting with the validation representation, we will provide datafetchers directly in Sirius Components to simplify the integration of Sirius Components in various applications. The project `sirius-components-graphql-utils` has been merged into `sirius-components-graphql-api` since they had similar dependencies.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [charts] The components related to charts have been extracted to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-charts`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [forms] The components related to forms have been extracted to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-forms`. The views and representations have adopted the suffix `View` and `Representation` respectively. As an example, the component `FormWebSocketContainer` is now named `FormRepresentation`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [formdescriptioneditors] The components related to formdescriptioneditors have been extracted to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-formdescriptioneditors`. The representation has been renamed `FormDescriptionEditorRepresentation`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [core] Since the core parts of Sirius Components cannot possibly known the components of the representations installed in a project, the context `RepresentationContext` will not provide a default value anymore. In a similar fashion, the `ServerContext` from `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-core` will now be required in order to let Sirius Components retrieve the URL of the backend.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [trees] The trees related components and the explorer have been extracted to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-trees`. The `ExplorerWebSocketContainer` has also been renamed `ExplorerView` to match the naming convention of the other views. The components migrated have also been fully converted to XState and MaterialUI
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [workbench] The workbench was depending on some tree components in order to compute the list of `TreeItemContextMenuContribution` to use in the explorer. This dependency has been removed and as a result, users of the workbench component will have to rely on the `TreeItemContextMenuContext` to provide the contributions
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [workbench] Move the workbench related code to `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-core`. This move includes components such as `Workbench`, `RepresentationContext`, `WorkbenchViewContribution` for example
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [diagram] Move the code of the diagram and the selection wizard in the packages `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-diagrams` and `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components-selection`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1231[#1231] [core] Some code remain in the soon to be deprecated Sirius Component package `@eclipse-sirius/sirius-components`. Most of this code will either be moved to Sirius Web or be removed entirely (such as the old non MaterialUI widgets)
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1288[#1288] [core] The `EditingContext#representationDescriptions` field now takes an `objectId: ID` as argument instead of just the object's `kind: ID`.
This allows representation precondition expressions to be more precise as they know the actual candidate instance, not just its type.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1281[#1281] [form] The `LinkDescription` now requires a `displayProvider` and a `styleProvider`. The `displayProvider` is used to display the text of the hyperLink.
The GraphQL API has also been changed with two additional fields on the type `Link`: `display` and `style` (optional). The front-end use the `display` value instead of the `label` value to display the hyperlink text.
The `label` value is displayed before the widget to be consistent with other properties sections.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1320[#1320] [diagram] The `selectedNode` variable is now always _defined_ in the context of drop handlers and single-click tools. Previously, if the target of the drop or single-click tool was the diagram itself (instead of a node), the variable was not defined at all. Now it is defined but `null` in these cases.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1289[#1289] [core] The `representationDescriptions` GraphQL query now returns a new attribute named `defaultName` in addition to the `label` and `id`. For view-based representations and , the `defaultName` is computed from the `RepresentationDescription`'s `titleExpression`.

=== Dependency update

- [frontend] Update the format of the `package-lock.json` by moving to node 18.7.0 and npm 8.15.0. This will allow us to use the latest version of npm which comes with improvements for its workspace support. This will also help us move beyond the change in behavior of https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4998[node 16.15.1 and npm 8.6]
- [frontend] Update the version of `jest-transform-css` used in order to fix the long standing issues of its incompatibility with the version of `postcss`` that we use. We will thus use `postcss 8.4.14` and `jest-transform-css 4.0.1` now
- [frontend] Remove our dependency to `ts-transform-graphql-tag` since it is not maintained and its dependencies are outdated and since it is used to lower the dependency with `graphql-tag` which we will stop using soon
- [frontend] Remove the peer dependency to `graphql-tag`. It will not be required for projects consuming Sirius Components now
- [frontend] Remove the peer dependency to `subscriptions-transport-ws`. It is not required by Sirius Components and consumers of Sirius Components will be free to switch to `graphql-ws` instead of even to not rely on web socket at all to communicate with the backend. Sirius Components itself does not need to specify how the communication with the backend will be done
- [frontend] Switch to `@apollo/client 3.6.9`, `@material-ui/core 4.12.4`, `@material-ui/icons 4.11.3`, `graphql 16.5.0`, `prop-types 15.8.1`, `sprotty 0.12.2` and `xstate 4.32.1`. Various development dependencies have also been updated such as typescript, rollup, prettier etc
- [backend] Switch to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.7.2[Spring Boot 2.7.2]
- [backend] Switch to the managed version of GraphQL Java, as of Spring Boot 2.7.2, we will thus use GraphQL Java 18.2

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1318[#1318] [studio] Java service classes used by studios (via `IJavaServiceProvider`) can now ask to be injected with any Spring bean available in the application context (for example `IObjectService` or other Sirius Components services they need for their implementation).
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1288[#1288] [core] Improve support for precondition expression from representation description

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1289[#1289] [core] Improve support for title expression from representation description.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1341[#1341] [diagram] Expose source and target node variables during EdgeTool execution
- [core] The input and payloads manipulated by the `EditingContextEventProcessor` can now be logged using `
logging.level.org.eclipse.sirius.components.collaborative.editingcontext.EditingContextEventProcessor=trace`

== v2022.7.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-60] Add support for d3 bars data-structure and bar-chart representation
- [ADR-61] Add support for flexbox containers on form description
- [ADR-62] Switch to a monorepo layout
- [ADR-63] Simplify the Sprotty integration
- [ADR-64] Add support for a ToggableAreaContainer in forms
- [ADR-65] Add support for a tree widget in forms
- [ADR-66] Add a new "Related Elements" view

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1141[#1141] [frontend] The `PropertiesWebSocketContainer` which was hard-coded to display the `propertiesEvent` subscription has been made more generic and renamed `FormBasedView`.
It now takes an additional prop named `subscriptionName` so that it can be bound to other subscriptions (which must follow the same API/protocol and send Form payloads).
To integrate the "Details" view inside a workbench, one must now use the new `DetailsView` component (which simply configures `FormBasedView` to listen to `propertiesEvent` as before).

=== Dependency update

- The frontend now depends on `@material-ui/lab` to support the new https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1139[tree widget] (see ADR-065).

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1242[#1242] [view] Provide icons for View DSL Widgets and FormDescription
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1214[#1214] [forms] The mandatory label attribute which was available in all concrete widget types is now explicitly part of the common supertype.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1215[#1215] [forms] Widgets can now optionally specify an `iconURL`. It is not used in the default UI for the details view or forms representations for now, but icons (if present) are visible in the toggle buttons bar for groups using the new `displayMode = TOGGLEABLE_AREAS`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1141[#1141] [workbench] It is now possible to add a "Related View" contribution to the workbench.
It behaves like the "Details" view in that it reacts to the selection by displaying a Form, but is designed to display contextual information about the selected element (i.e. which elements it points to and which elements point to it for example).
The actual definition of the application (e.g. Sirius Web), which must provide a single bean implementing the new `IRelatedElementsDescriptionProvider` interface.

=== Deprecation warning

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1088[#1088] [core] Change the type of `IRepresentationDescription#id` from UUID to String.
This will allow us, when we will receive an operation to perform with a given representation description identifier, to determine if this operation should be handled by the Sirius Desktop compatibility layer, the View support or by a programmatic API
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1138[#1138] [workbench] The APIs for the `Panels` and `Site` components have been modified to support closing/opening the panels.
In particular, `Panels` now handles all three parts of the layout (the left and right sites and the main area) directly instead of using recursive two-sided panels.
See ADR-54 for the details.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1155[#1155] [workbench] `WorkbenchViewContribution` now require an `icon` prop
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1155[#1155] [core] The palette used by Sirius Components now require two additional colors for the navigation area. The type of the new palette is described in `frontend/src/materialui.ts`. Users of the fallback theme can upgrade without having to add those new colors since they are provided by default.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/966[#966] [core] The source and target edge anchor are not considered as routing points anymore. Edges of old diagrams may have unexpected behavior since new edges will have two less routing points than existing edges in old diagrams. For further explanation see ADR-054.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1180[#1180] [diagram] An implementation of `IConnectorToolsProvider` has to be made for the connector tool to work.

=== Dependency update

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1118[#1118] [core] Switch to Spring Boot 2.6.6

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1140[#1140] [forms] The frontend now depends on `@material-ui/lab` version 4.0.0-alpha.61

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1154[#1154] [diagram] Display the palette where the click has been made, not where the cursor is. With the edge animation it was possible for the palette to be displayed at a wrong position which was making possible to create a floating edge.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1148[#1148] [diagram] Fix a lot of cases where removing an edge will change the layout of some other edges. This behavior will still happen when it will exist two edges between the two same elements and one of the edge is removed, the other edge will probably take the layout of the removed edge.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1176[#1176] [diagram] Fix potential ConcurrentModificationException in ViewDiagramDescriptionConverter when manipulating diagrams. This bug was introduced by the https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1152[#1152].

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/966[#966] [diagram] Add the support source and target edge position ratio on the frontend side. For further explanation see ADR-055.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1179[#1179] [core] Move `WorkbenchSelection` and `WorkbenchSelectionEntry` to `sirius-components-representations` in order to let any representation use those classes. We may rename the `Selection` representation in the future in order to rename them to `Selection` and `SelectionEntry` to align the frontend and backend API
- [releng] Detect the presence of classes without a public visibility or with a package or protected constructor in order to speed up the code reviews.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1138[#1138] [workbench] The left and right panels can be closed by clicking on the current view's icon or by resizing them to the minimum width (showing only the icons).
When closed, clicking on any of the views' icon will re-open the panel to make the selected view visible.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/689[#689] [diagram] Add a variable containing objects ids to render for unsynchronized nodes rendering

- [ADR-049] Improve the incremental layout for dropper elements

=== Deprecation warning
- [core] The various DTOs related to the creation and renaming of both documents and representations will be removed from the project at some point. The only reason why we will keep them for the moment is that some of them are used to trigger some specific behavior in the `EditingContextEventProcessor`. The split of the representation metadata should help us remove those special use cases
- [core] The method `IRepresentationMetadataSearchService#findByRepresentation` will be deleted in the future, it only exists as a transition from requesting the whole content of a representation every time to requesting only its metadata when it's necessary
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/779[#779] [diagram] The properties `DiagramDescription#toolSections` should be removed in the near future since it has no real reason to exist now that the tools are computed on the fly. On top of that, `ITool.handler` will also be deleted at the same time since we no longer need to create the handlers of all the tools while the server is starting
- [diagram] The GraphQL mutations `deleteFromDiagram` will stop being used soon by the delete from model and delete from diagram tools. They will instead be considered as regular tools and thus leverage the "invoke tool" GraphQL API

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/808[#808] [core] Update the namespace of the projects from `sirius-web-xxx` to `sirius-components-xxx`. The projects `sirius-web-api` and `sirius-web-core-api` have been merged into `sirius-components-core` since there was no difference in scope between both projects and neither of them was strictly limited to an api. Since we have validated that most of our projects can be reused outside of a Spring environment (i.e. an environment where Spring Frameworks is in charge of the ApplicationContext), we have also removed the `-spring-` from most of our project names. We already had Spring dependencies outside of those `-spring-` projects anyway.
- [core] Switch to the `org.eclipse.sirius` groupId in order to prepare for a future publication of our backend on maven central
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/808[#808] [core] Update the namespace of the packages from `org.eclipse.sirius.web.xxx` to `org.eclipse.sirius.components.xxx`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/998[#998] [core] Remove the various annotations used to support a code-first approach to build the GraphQL schema
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/975[#975] [core] Remove useless parts of the GraphQL API which were both unused by the Sirius Components frontend and not handled by the Sirius Components backend
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/959[#959] [diagram] Remove the concept of `DeleteTool`. This concept was not useful since any tool can perform a deletion
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1018[#1018] [core] Remove the default implementation of `IRepresentationMetadataSearchService` since products integrating Sirius Components needs the ability to customize its behavior
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1019[#1019] [core] Services now have access to the context of the request triggering their execution. Consumer of Sirius Components will have to provide the `RequestAttributes`` in the `RequestContextHolder`` to make the `EditingContextEventProcessor`` work. It should be very easy for those in a Spring environment, but it is not automatic for those outside of a Spring environment
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/699[#699] [core] The `IRepresentationImageProvider` will now use the `kind` of the representation instead of the instance to compute the image. It will allow users to ask for the image of a representation with either its instance or its metadata
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/699[#699] [core] Add the `targetObjectId` to the `RepresentationMetadata`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1045[#1045] [core] Providers will now return List<?> instead of List<Object>. This makes it possible for applications to reuse existing services to implement providers without making useless copies of lists
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1068[#1068] [form] The form representation is now supporting multiple elements as an input
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1068[#1068] [workbench] The integration of the details view in the workbench is not limited to semantic objects with a kind starting with `siriusComponents://semantic`. Any object can be used as the input of the details view and we will now provide the identifier of all the objects in the selection. This may include graphical elements such as nodes, edges, representations or anything selected in the explorer for example
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/693[#693] [workbench] The workbench non longer hard-codes the views which are visible in the left and right side-panels. Instead, each application must explicitly configure its workbench using the new `WorkbenchViewContribution` element. See ADR-046 for more details. As part of this change, the `ExplorerWebSocketContainerProps`, `PropertiesWebSocketContainerProps`, `RepresentationsWebSocketContainerProps` and `ValidationWebSocketContainer` types have been removed and replaced with the single `WorkbenchViewComponentProps` type which is structurally equivalent.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/779[#779] [diagram] Change the signature of the GraphQL API used to retrieve the tools of the diagram's contextual palette in order to include the identifier of the diagram element
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1022[#1022] [diagram] The `NodeCreationEvent` and the `EdgeCreationEvent` have been renamed to `SinglePositionEvent` and `DoublePositionEvent` to distinguish from any imagined behavior. Additional tests of the incremental layout should be added in the future to test its behavior in use cases that we did not consider in the past. The `CreateNodeTool` and `CreateEdgeTool` have also been renamed in order to describe how the user interact with them instead of the behavior that we imagine they have. Their associated mutations have also been renamed. See the ADR for additional details

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/956[#956] [diagram] Add the border node concept on front-end and implement the border node snap. The user can move the border node only on the side of its parent node. The border node enters its parent node with 8px. The ELK automatic layout is adapted to have the same behavior.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1081[#1081] [workbench] It is now possible to specify the component to display in the main area when no representation is open instead of the `OnboardArea` (which is still the default when there is no override)
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/1070[#1070] [explorer] When selecting an element or opening a representation (for example from its URL or from the onboard area), it is automatically made visible and selected in the explorer.

- [ADR-38] Improve the layout of multiple edges between the same nodes

=== Deprecation warning
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/858[#858] [core] Our dependency to Spring Security will be reduced or eliminated soon. Sirius Components will now longer have any opinion on matters of authentication, authorization, principal management, etc. All those concerns will be out of the scope of the project. It will also be way easier to integrate Sirius Components in a Spring based application since it won't come with this additional requirement

=== Breaking changes
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/858[#858] [core] Remove most of the methods of `ISubscriptionManager` since they were not really useful
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/871[#871] [core] Change the constructor of the `EditingContextEventProcessor` in order to let consumers provide an `IEditingContextEventProcessorExecutorServiceProvider`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/134[#134] [workbench] Switch from a single-selection API to a multi-selection API with some changes to the `Selection` object of the workbench
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/878[#878] [core] As specified in the ADR-36, the kind of an object (representation, semantic elements, selection entry of the workbench) is now an URI. All previous kind values have been modified
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/878[#878] [graphql] The GraphQL argument `classId` which appeared on some fields has been replaced by `kind` since it was always the `kind` of an object. Technically, it is always the kind of a semantic element but that may not be the case forever
- [core] `IEditService.findClass()` has been removed
- [core] `IRepresentationDescriptionSearchService` has a new `findAll` method to return all the representation descriptions available in a given editing context
- [core] The package containing the concepts related to the editing context has been renamed to remove references to the project
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/932[#932] [graphql] Introduce the RepresentationMetadata concept in order to prepare the separation of the metadata from the representation

- [frontend] Switch to typescript 4.5.4
- [frontend] Switch to @typescript-eslint/parser 5.7.0
- [frontend] Switch to xstate 4.26.1
- [frontend] Update various development dependencies such as Rollup, ESLint, Prettier and Jest

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/726[#726] [view] Nodes can now have a dynamically computed size (using `sizeComputationExpression`) which depends on the current state of the semantic model.
If the expression is present and produces a positive integer, it will be used as both the width and height of the node, in pixels.
Currently it is not possible to compute different values for width and height.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/133[#133] [diagram] Add a connector tool to help create edges in diagrams
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/596[#596] [view] It is now possible to define border nodes in dynamic diagram definitions

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/822[#822] [diagram] Add support for graphical deletion. We can now offer a dedicated menu in the user interface to perform a graphical deletion instead of a semantic one. On the backend, the compatibility layer has been updated to perform a `DeletionViewRequest` if there is no default deletion tool and a new variable named `deletionPolicy` is available to determine if the deletion should be performed graphically or semantically
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/943[#943] [view] Add support for optional begin & end labels on edges in views
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/822[#822] [view] Handle 'Delete from Diagram' in view-based diagrams

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/871[#871] [core] An `IEditingContextEventProcessorExecutorServiceProvider` can be given to the `EditingContextEventProcessor` in order to customize the `ExecutorService` which will be used to handle the processing of the `IInput` received. This will allow consumers to change the thread management policy of Sirius Components
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/134[#134] [workbench] The internal API of the workbench is now ready to accept features leveraging a multi-selection
- [form] Add a tooltip to always make the full label available
- [core] Customize the Spring `ObjectMapper` instead of creating a brand new one from scratch in our `ObjectMapperConfiguration`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/896[#896] [diagram] Allow to make specific changes before and after the layout
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/897[#897] [compatibility] The Bordered Node Dot Style is now handled in the compatibility layer

== v2021.12.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-032] Relax our ID policy for editing context and representation (update)
- [ADR-034] Switch from semver to calver
- [ADR-035] Use a common pattern for configuration properties
- [ADR-036] Adopt a more structured selection

=== Deprecation warning

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/818[#818] [workbench] The concept of `Selection` will be restructured, as described in the ADR-036. Every part of the code involved in the manipulation of the selection of the workbench will be impacted. This includes concepts as remote as the representation descriptions which are used to computed fields like `kind`. For example, the behavior of the `TreeDescription#getKindProvider` and `NodeDescription#getTargetObjectKindProvider` will have to be updated for all the providers. Failure to update to the new behavior will make the selection fail in the workbench
- [core] The Success parameterless constructor will be removed soon.

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/804[#804] [core] Update the name of our configuration properties. The configuration property `sirius.web.graphql.websocket.allowed.origins` will now be `sirius.components.cors.allowedOriginPatterns` and it will support complex patterns on top of regular origins. The default value will be restored to nothing since it has temporarily been set to `*`. In a development environment, the recommended value would be both patterns `https://localhost:[*]` and `http://localhost:[*]` in order to accept requests from any application hosted on the same machine. The configuration property `org.eclipse.sirius.web.editingContextEventProcessorRegistry.disposeDelay` will now be `sirius.components.editingContext.disposeDelay`. Its default value will be 1s since it is the only realistic option with domain and view support.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/692[#692] [explorer] The explorer view is now more generic and extensible. It can represent arbitrary kinds of tree items, but the tree items supported must be configured for each application.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/700[#700] [core] editingContextId and representationId are no longer UUID but String. Products that rely on sirius-components will be able to have their own ID policy for the editingContextId and representationId.

=== Dependency update

- [core] Switch to Spring Boot 2.5.6

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/773[#773] [compatibility] Add support for both `createView` and `deleteView` model operations which can be used to support unsynchronized diagrams from Sirius Desktop.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/694[#694] [core] Add `IRepresentationRefreshPolicyRegistry` to contribute `IRepresentationRefreshPolicyProvider`s in order to customize on which kind of change description, representations will be refreshed.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/613[#613] [compatibility] Add support for external java action with the new API `IExternalJavaActionProvider` which allows others to provide instances of `IExternalJavaAction` in order to perform some custom behavior during the execution of a tool for example.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/154[#154] [diagram] Add support for the edition of the label of an edge

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/799[#799] [diagram] The buttons in the diagram's toolbar now have proper tooltips
- [core] Add a task to display TypeScript errors in the VS Code problems view
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/773[#773] [compatibility] The synchronization policy of the node descriptions is now properly computed from the `AbstractNodeMapping`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/694[#694] [core] Data can be provided to Success in order to notify changement made by operation made on the editing context.
- [explorer] The context menus on explorer items has been migrated to Material UI
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/692[#692] [tree] The tree representation will now act as a proper representation. Its event handlers will now be implementations of  `ITreeEventHandler` and its input will be implementations of `ITreeInput`
- [diagram] The variable `selectedNode` is now available even if there are no `selectedObject` from a selection representation
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/817[#817] [core] Improve the TypeScript typing of the frontend
- [form] Add support for property groups defined in a different category

=== Bug fixes

- [diagram] The variable `selectedNode` was only available in the variable manager used when executing node tools if a selection dialog was also available. Now the `selectedNode` variable will always be available unless the tool has been invoked on the background of the diagram

== v0.5.0

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-024] Add support for view deletion requests
- [ADR-025] Switch to a schema first approach for our GraphQL schema
- [ADR-026] Improve the performance of unsynchronized nodes
- [ADR-027] Make the explorer independent from modeling concepts
- [ADR-028] Move representations out of the explorer
- [ADR-029] Introduce some object services
- [ADR-030] Add a link representation
- [ADR-031] Separate metadata representations
- [ADR-032] Relax our constraints on some of our identifiers
- [ADR-033] Add support for unsynchronized tools

=== Deprecation warning

- [core] The field `ChangeKind#NOTHING` will be removed soon since we have the option to just not send anything at all
- [explorer] Representations will be removed from the explorer soon
- [core] The metadata of the representations will be removed from the content of the representation soon. As a result, fields like `IRepresentation#id`, `IRepresentation#descriptionId` or event `IRepresentation#label` will be removed. It will allow us to massively improve the performance of some use cases and simplify the manipulation of the representations in other use cases
- [workbench] The workbench will become independent of internal concepts from Sirius Components. As a result, the explorer will not have any hardcoded actions such as "create a new document" or "create a new representation". The concept of document will be removed from the frontend entirely
- [graphql] The interface `ITypeProvider` will soon be removed
- [graphql] All the GraphQL annotations used to build the schema programmatically will be removed soon such as `@GraphQLObjectType`, `@GraphQLField`, `@GraphQLNonNull`, `@GraphQLID`. Annotations used to execute GraphQL queries like `@QueryDataFetcher` or `@MutationDataFetcher` will still be supported

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/673[#673] [graphql] Rename namespace to domain in the GraphQL API
- [core] Remove the need to give a logger to the `BaseRender`
- [properties] Remove useless fields from the properties payloads
- [graphql] Use pagination for the fields used by the onboarding such as `EditingContext#stereotypeDescriptions` or `EditingContext#representations`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/563[#563] [core] Update the support for custom images by referencing images by their identifiers instead of their file name
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/683[#683] [core] Move projects such as `sirius-web-services-api`, `sirius-web-services`, `sirius-web-graphql-schema` and `sirius-web-graphql` out of Sirius Components
- [core] Remove all the `sirius-web-collaborative-XXX-api` projects. Those projects became a random collection of all the interfaces (external APIs and internal ones) used by the collaborative projects. Those interfaces now exist within the various collaborative projects
- [graphql] Remove the field `ErrorPayload#additionalMessages` since it was useless
- [graphql] Remove the principal from the GraphQL `Context` since Spring Security allows us to access it much more easily
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/744[#744] [core] Use Reactor to communicate event handler results. As a result of this change, the concept of `EventHandlerResponse` has been removed and replaced with two different sinks. The `payloadSink` should be used to communicate a response to the process which has sent the input to handler. The `changeDescriptionSink` can be used in order to indicate to the other event processors a change that has occur. Such change may trigger a refresh or other behavior in the other event processors
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/727[#727] [core] Make `IRepresentationDescriptionSearchService` editing context aware
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/750[#750] [core] Add the ability to provide a status error message. The enumeration `Status` has been replaced by an interface named `IStatus` with two classes implementing it, `Failure` and `Success`. Thanks to `Failure`, it is now possible to provide a custom error message for an event handler but as of today this error message is not used in the `ErrorPayload` created from the `Failure`. This will change in the future
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/740[#740] [domain] Remove the explicit `nsURI` from domain definitions. Now only a name will be required and other properties will be computed from said name (`nsURI` and `nsPrefix`).

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/190[#190] [emf] Add support for inverse references navigation thanks to an `ECrossReferenceAdapter` installed directly on the `EditingContext`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/588[#588] [domain] Add support for multiple inheritance
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/598[#598] [view] Add support for node border size, edge width, label font format and node label color in the view language
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/514[#514] [diagram] Disable move, resize and arrange all on auto-layout diagram
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/688[#688] [core] Add support for cross site request forgery token while uploading files. Projects integrating Sirius Components will have to decide whether or not they want to add such support and if they want to activate it. It will not be supported for now in Sirius Web
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/671[#671] [graphql] Add the GraphQL schemas of Sirius Components. Starting with this commit, projects integrating Sirius Components will be able to easily embrace a schema first approach to build their GraphQL schema. It will also be way easier to track changes to our GraphQL schema over time
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/697[#697] [graphql] Add the ability to perform AQL based queries on the content of an editing context using the `queryBasedXxx` fields
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/672[#672] [diagram] Add support for the `ViewDeletionRequest` in a similar fashion as the previously added `ViewCreationRequest` in order to support unsynchronized diagram description created programmatically

=== Improvements

- [domain] Add multiple validation rules to help create proper domains
- [view] Add validation rules to help create proper views

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/654[#654] [domain] Set `Feature#optional` default value to `true` since `false` created serialization issues. We cannot provide `false` as a default value since EMF cannot handle such use case
- [diagram] Make the `DiagramRenderingCache` maps predictable in order to improve performances
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/735[#735] [view] Ensure that the generic edge tool is not used when a custom one is provided

- [core] Add a fallback strategy to the payload sink. With the use of reactor to the event handler, it has become possible to handle an input without ever providing a payload as a response. Now after 5s without a response, an `ErrorPayload` will be send back. This will not stop the current processing of the input nor will it rollback any change made, it will only send a response to ensure that the frontend is not waiting forever for an answer
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/776[#776] [view] Avoid id collision between diagram descriptions with the same name by leveraging the URI of the diagram description to create a more unique identifier


== v0.4.0 (2021-07-30)

This new release improves support for meta modeling.
It also prepares the removal of a lot of code from this repository.
Sirius Components will soon be independent from any persistence layer, from the GraphQL layer and even from a specific business layer.

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-020] Add support for validation in the workbench
- [ADR-021] Add validation support to forms
- [ADR-022] Add support for selection dialog
- [ADR-023] Move business code from Sirius Components to Sirius Web

=== Deprecation warning

- [core] All the GraphQL and business related projects will be move to the Sirius Web project. As a result, projects such as `sirius-web-services-api`, `sirius-web-services`, `sirius-web-graphql-schema` and `sirius-web-graphql` will no longer exist in this repository

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/569[#569] [emf] Move document-related code out of `sirius-web-emf`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/569[#569] [core] Remove the last dependency to `sirius-web-services` from `sirius-web-emf`. As a result, the `ObjectService` does not need to know about representations anymore

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/562[#562] [core] Remove multiple references to `projectId` from the collaborative parts. This will impact various concepts such as the input used to edit forms
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/584[#584] [graphql] Remove all the GraphQL projects from `sirius-web-spring-starter`. As such, projects consuming Sirius Components will now have to explicitly depend to those projects. They will soon be removed entirely from Sirius Components to go Sirius Web
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/584[#584] [core] Remove the need to perform some access control and remove the `IDataFetcherEnvironmentService` in favor of `ObjectMapper`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/589[#589] [core] Remove `sirius-web-services` from `sirius-web-spring-starter`. Our business layer will soon be moved out of Sirius Components to Sirius Web
- [core] Remove the unused `ProjectCreatedEvent`
- [core] Remove the support for modelers since it has never been used
- [core] Refactor the collaborative layer in order to make it easier to reuse in other applications. This change includes a large set of small API breaks to concepts such as `IRepresentationService` or `IRepresentationSearchService`
- [core] Provide the editing context while searching and saving representations instead of its identifier. As a result, interfaces such as `IRepresentationPersistenceService` and `IRepresentationSearchService` have been modified

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/554[#554] [core] Add support for the validation view
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/428[#428] [properties] Add support for the edition of multi-valued references in the properties view

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/451[#451] [diagram] Fix the issue which caused one character to be swallowed during the direct edit of a label in a diagram

== v0.3.0 (2021-05-18)

In this third major release, we have introduced support for the meta modeling in the web browser with the new domain and view languages.

In order to make Sirius Components even more reusable, we have removed all of the views of the frontend.
Sirius Components will no longer have an opinion on the architecture of the whole frontend application which will include the workbench.
It will only provide as frontend components, representations, the workbench and some utility components but not the core structure of a full web application.

On the backend side, things are moving in the same direction with some massive refactoring for the future removal of the persistence layer and the business layer from Sirius Components.
All the related projects will soon move to Sirius Web in order to integrate more easily Sirius Components in applications which do not share the same architectural constraints as Sirius Web.

Some improvements have also been made to the incremental layout in order to support a basic workflow.


=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-011] Decouple the event handlers from the refresh
- [ADR-012] Incremental layout: Make it possible to move or create a diagram element at a specific position
- [ADR-013] Refactor incremental layout
- [ADR-014] Add a correlation identifier to inputs and payloads
- [ADR-015] Add support for resizing diagram elements
- [ADR-016] Remove SubscriptionDescription
- [ADR-017] Improve the source and target edge anchors
- [ADR-018] Adopt a subset of Ecore to define data schemas for modelers
- [ADR-019] Support Simple Diagram Definitions by Reusing Sirius Desktop VSMs

=== Deprecation warning

- [core] All the business code will be removed from Sirius Components in the months to come (project, document, persistence-related code, etc). This will include projects such as `sirius-web-persistence`, `sirius-web-services-api` and more
- [core] The support for custom images has been integrated as a prototype. Massive changes to its API will occur in the future in order to cleanup its lifecycle
- [core] The concept `IDataFetchingEnvironmentService` which can be used to setup an access control policy will soon be removed since it will be up to each application to define its own policy

=== Breaking changes

- [core] Make views handle the lifecycle of their navbar instead of relying on a common navbar design and lifecycle. This will lower the complexity of the lifecycle of the views and give way more flexibility to the views
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/342[#342] [core] Introduce the `ChangeKind` concept to decouple event handlers from representation. Prior to this change, an event handler had to know the behavior of all the representations in order to find out which representations were impacted by its change. Now, it can describe the change made and each representation can find out if this change is relevant to them or not
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/348[#348] [core] Add a correlation identifier on `IInput` and `IPayload`. From now on all payloads created must have, as an identifier, the identifier of the input which has trigger their creation. This will give us the ability to provide advanced features in the future and improve our debugging capabilities now
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/351[#351] [core] Transform `ChangeKind` into `ChangeDescription` in order to encapsulate the source of the change too. This will allow a representation to distinguish between a `SEMANTIC_CHANGE` coming from another representation and one coming from itself
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/347[#347] [diagram] Replace `Size` and `Position` builders by `Size#of` and `Position#at`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/378[#378] [core] Make the stereotype description editing context aware. As a result, the `IStereotypeDescriptionService` and some related classes are now manipulating an extra parameter in some methods, the `editingContextId`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/368[#368] [core] Remove the now useless `PreDestroyPayload`
- [properties] Remove the `PropertiesEventProcessor` which has never been used. Both the properties and the form representation are using the `FormEventProcessor`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/357[#357] [core] Remove the `SubscriptionDescription` and use instead the Spring `SecurityContextHolder` to retrieve the user subscribing to a reactive flux. As a result, this change will give us the ability to use much more easily other GraphQL integration in Spring such as Netflix DGS
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/268[#268] [core] Dispose instances of `IEditingContextEventProcessor` when they are not used anymore. This change introduce some minor evolutions to the API of `IDisposablePublisher` and `IEditingContextEventProcessorRegistry` which can impact any custom `IRepresentationEventProcessor`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/377[#377] [graphql] Rename the `projectEvent` subscription to `editingContextEvent`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/382[#382] [diagram] Switch the type of the label identifier from `String` to `UUID`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/384[#384] [explorer] Make the child creation descriptions editing context aware in order to leverage the domain to compute the children
- [core] Remove the now useless `Subscriber` component
- [compatibility] Remove the now useless `CanCreateMappingTester` and `ToolDescriptionQuery`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/386[#386] [graphql] Make the representation creation editing context aware. This will move the field `representationDescriptions` on the editing context in the GraphQL schema
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/333[#333] [core] Make `IEditService#findClass` editing context aware
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/402[#402] [core] Remove all views from Sirius Components. Sirius Components will stop trying to provide a complete product but it will instead be used as a framework which can be used to build collaborative graphical applications. As a result, the views have been removed and most of them been transferred to Sirius Web.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/473[#473] [explorer] Improve the support for the read only workbench. This change introduce some API changes in several key workbench components such as `PropertiesWebSocketContainer`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/449[#449] [core] Move the navigation bar to MaterialUI. This change also removes the `LoggedInNavbar` and introduces the `NavigationBar`
- [core] Remove the now useless components such as `Navbar`, `ErrorView`, `View`, `Go`, `UserStatus` and `Footer`
- [core] Remove the now useless hooks such as `useCapabilities`, `useBranding`, `useAuth`

== v0.2.0 (2021-02-12)

Second major release of Sirius Components after the move to an open source project.

Sirius Components was the core part of the proprietary product Obeo Cloud Platform up until a couple months ago.
We have transferred in the Eclipse Foundation most of the code of Obeo Cloud Platform to become both Sirius Web and its core part Sirius Components which should be reusable in multiple applications.

In this release, we have made some major refactoring in order to separate some remaining business concern which are specific to Sirius Web from the core goals of Sirius Web.
These improvements are not complete and some of them will need to be improved down the road but the structure of the project is starting to be more visible.

=== Architectural decision records

- [ADR-007] Adopt stable identifiers for diagrams
- [ADR-008] Add support for incremental layout
- [ADR-009] Adopt a proper versioning strategy
- [ADR-010] Reduce the coupling of our collaborative support

=== Deprecation warning

- [core] The hook `useProject` will soon be removed. It's original goal was to provide the ability to subscribe to a project related subscription but this subscription has never really been used. It was way too much used to simply fetch a project while this could be done with way less dependencies
- [core] Any usage of `projectId` in the collaborative parts or in the representation related code will be removed in the upcoming months
- [core] All frontend code using our custom React widgets such as `Button`, `Text`, `Spacing`, `Checkbox` etc will be modified to use MaterialUI instead
- [core] All frontend code using custom made state machines instead of XState based ones will be migrated to XState

=== Breaking changes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Introduce the `sirius-web-core-api` project and move some core concepts from the services API into the new core API project such as `IEditingContext`, `IPayload` and `IInput`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Introduce the `sirius-web-services` project and move some business related concepts like `Document`, `Project` and `ProjectService` out of the collaborative projects
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the dependency to the persistence from the collaborative API
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the `Context` concept which was used to propagate the authenticated principal to the business code. It was given to more than 70 classes while used by only a couple of them. On top of that, Spring's `SecurityContextHolder` can perform the same job with a much lower coupling. This will help reduce the coupling between the collaborative parts and the services API
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the useless `IProjectInput` and replace its usage with `IInput`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove all dependencies to `sirius-web-services-api` from `sirius-web-collaborative-api`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the `ProjectRenamedEventPayload` to allow us to prepare the future deletion of the `useProject` hook and the complete removal of business concerns from the collaborative layer
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Rename the `ProjectEventProcessor` to `EditingContextEventProcessor`. This concept and its registry have been made independent of `Project`. Those concepts will stop relying on a `projectId` but an `editingContextId` instead even if in practice this variable will still contain the value of `projectId` for now.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Remove the method `IEditingContext#getDomain`. This method will now only be available on the EMF specific version of the `IEditingContext`. This contraint was not useful for alternate implementations
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [core] Move the `RenameRepresentationInput` to the `sirius-web-collaborative-api and `IObjectService` to the `sirius-web-core-api`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [explorer] Use `editingContextId` instead of `projectId` in the explorer
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [properties] Move properties related services to form related projects
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/241[#241] [diagram] Remove the dependency to `sirius-web-services-api` in `sirius-web-spring-collaborative-diagrams` thanks to the introduction of two new projects `sirius-web-diagrams-services-api` and `sirius-web-diagrams-services`. These two new projects are used to allow someone else to use a different persistence strategy for the diagrams. It will need to be refined but this solution allows us to isolate our dependency to the IRepresentationRepository
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/292[#292] [workbench] Restructure the components used by the workbench to make it reusable by consumers of Sirius Components. Components such as `DiagramWebSocketContainer` and `PropertiesWebSocketContainer` have thus been modified. In order to make it easier to reuse a Sirius Components workbench a component named `Workbench` has been created and new types such as `Selection`, `Representation` and `WorkbenchProps` have been introduced
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/303[#303] [business] Remove the link to modelers from the project context menu. Since we will not have time to fix the modelers before the release, we will not show this feature to end users and instead remove links to the modeler related pages

=== New features

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/256[#256] [emf] Add support for composed images for `IObjectService#getImage`
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/220[#220] [core] Add a basic support for the creation and edition of modelers
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/131[#131] [diagram] Add feedback to diagrams to indicate that tools cannot be applied
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/232[#232] [diagram] Add first support for incremental layout
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/153[#153] [workbench] Add the ability to close representations by adding a MaterialUI tabbar to display representations
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/293[#293] [workbench] Lower the coupling between the workbench and representations by introducing the `RepresentationContext` and the type `RepresentationComponentProps` for all representation components which replaces types such as `DiagramWebSocketContainerProps`. The `RepresentationContext` can be used to contribute additional representations to the Sirius Components workbench.
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/296[#296] [core] Introduce the `ServerContext` in order to customize the URL of the server used by the frontend components. This will allow consumers of Sirius Components to specify a different `httpOrigin` to organize their frontend and backend in a very different manner

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/252[#252] [diagram] Improve the TypeScript typing of the `DiagramWebSocketContainer` with the introduction of `Selection` and a dedicated `DiagramWebSocketContainerProps`
- [releng] Trigger the build on any pull requests regardless of their origin
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/283[#283] [graphql] Add the `EditingContext` to the GraphQL API
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/261[#261] [emf] Improve the perform of the `DocumentService` by removing some useless loading and serializing steps of EMF resources
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/238[#238] [diagram] Migrate the `DiagramWebSocketContainer` to XState and MaterialUI

=== Bug fixes

- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/278[#278] [diagram] Ensure that we are always sending the latest diagram state and not the initial state when new users subscribe to an already opened diagram
- https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components/issues/295[#295] [diagram] Fix a bug which could lead to the creation of a diagram containing labels with the same identifier
